abstract = {Critical metals are technologically vital to the functionality of various emerging technologies, yet they have a potentially unstable supply. This condition calls for strategic planning based on the expected long-term demand and supply of these metals and the implications attached. Here, we provide the first systematic review of studies (88 studies in all) exploring the projected long-term status of various critical materials, covering 48 elements with 546 data points for global demand through 2030 and 2050. Interestingly, results indicate that, to date, no long-term demand outlook is available for some high criticality metals. We also find that the social and environmental implications induced by demand growth are largely overlooked in these studies, resulting in less attention being given to the spatial divergence between consuming and producing countries in the global supply chain. Moreover, circular economy strategies that include component reuse and remanufacturing have been barely incorporated into the modelling frameworks presented in these studies, while end-of-life recycling is heavily focused on. In addition, elemental linkages (e.g., indium-zinc-steel) are underemphasized, leading to a lack of understanding of future availability and sustainable cycles. All of these findings affirm the need for further scientific research that explores the long-term status of critical metals, which strongly connects to the sustainable development goals of the United Nations and implementation of the Paris Agreement. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract = {This study analysed demand for 12 metals in global climate mitigation scenarios up to 2060 and quantified the impacts on demand of different assumptions on improvements and technological mix. Annual and cumulative demands were compared with reserves and current mining rates. The study results showed that reserves are sufficient to support the total level of solar power, wind power and electric motors. Insufficient reserves may very well constrain certain sub-technologies, but substitutes that take the role of ‘back-stop' technologies can be used instead. The exception is batteries, since lithium battery chemistries and reserves were incompatible with the scenarios analysed. Batteries of moderate size, lithium-free chemistry or reserve expansion would make the transition feasible. Choice of sub-technology (e.g. type of solar PV) had a decisive impact on demand for certain metals. Perceptions that many metals are critical and scarce for renewable energy transitions appear exaggerated if a dynamic view on technological development is adopted. Policy-relevant conclusions can be drawn from this, regarding e.g. the benefits of technological diversity, increasing metal intensity, recycling and integrating infrastructure and energy policies (e.g. fast chargers). {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors},

The analysis focuses on three factors with potential geopolitical importance: the geographic concentration of resources, potential revenues of resources rich countries and the size of total global markets. The geographic concentration of most of the fourteen studied metals and metalloids will be higher than for oil. The only exceptions are tellurium, copper and silicon. The economic revenues as fraction of total economic throughput will be rather low for most of the countries studied. This will reduce the risk for a resource curse to emerge. The exceptions are the Democratic republic of Congo, Chile, Cuba, Madagascar and Zambia. The total economic value of the studied metals and metalloids will also be much smaller than the current oil market.},

abstract = {Global energy transitions could fundamentally change flows of both minerals and energy resources over time. It is, therefore, increasingly important to holistically and dynamically capture the impacts of large-scale energy transitions on resource flows including hidden flows such as mine waste, as well as direct flows. Here we demonstrate a systematic model that can quantify resource flows of both minerals and energy resources under the energy transition by using stock-flow dynamics and the concept of Total Material Requirement (TMR). The proposed model was applied to the International Energy Agency's scenarios up to 2050, targeting 15 electricity generation and 5 transport technologies. Results indicate that the global energy transition could increase TMR flows associated with mineral production by around 200–900% in the electricity sector and 350–700% in the transport sector respectively from 2015 to 2050, depending on the scenarios. Such a drastic increase in TMR flows is largely associated with an increased demand for copper, silver, nickel, lithium and cobalt, as well as steel. Our results highlight that the decarbonization of the electricity sector can reduce energy resource flows and support the hypothesis that the expansion of low-carbon technologies could reduce total resource flows expressed as TMR. In the transport sector, on the other hand, the dissemination of Electric Vehicles could cause a sharp increase in TMR flows associated with mineral production, which could offset a decrease in energy resource flows. Findings in this study emphasize that a sustainable transition would be unachievable without designing resource cycles with a nexus approach. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract = {Increasing recovery of critical raw materials (CRMs) from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is a strategic priority to mitigate supply risks. Today, CRM recovery rates are generally low, with increases requiring new recovery processes and interface optimisation with pre-processing to ensure appropriate material flows for efficient recovery are generated. Here, results from an industrial trial to increase CRM recovery from WEEE are presented to inform development of pre-processing strategies which generate such material flows. Au, Ag, Co, Ga, Mg, Nb, Ru, Pd, Ir, Y, Nd, Sb, Ta and W are identified with XRF in components of a range of WEEE samples including within individual printed circuit board (PCB) components. CRM distribution in PCBs is mapped by visual inspection with reference to this data. Cost-effective methods to disassemble WEEE; isolate CRM bearing components, and upgrade/concentrate CRMs are evaluated for industrial adoption. A guillotine is found most suitable for LCD disassembly and separation of Au edge-contacts from PCBs, while cryocracking is best for isolation of internal components of digital media devices. Thermal PCB disassembly with a solder bath for simultaneous SMD removal and subsequent sieving to sort SMDs thereby concentrating CRMs for recovery is a promising approach. Microwave ashing of PCBs to concentrate CRMs is promising although off-gas treatment would be required. Recovery potential of identified CRMs from material streams generated is found to be poor due to lack of suitable recovery infrastructure except for precious and platinum group metals in PCBs, but available pyrometallurgical recovery permanently dissipates other CRMs present. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract = {For most materials used to provide buildings, infrastructure, equipment and products, global stocks are still sufficient to meet anticipated demand, but the environmental impacts of materials production and processing, particularly those related to energy, are rapidly becoming critical. These impacts can be ameliorated to some extent by the ongoing pursuit of efficiencies within existing processes, but demand is anticipated to double in the next 40 years, and this will lead to an unacceptable increase in overall impacts unless the total requirement for material production and processing is reduced. This is the goal of material efficiency, and this paper aims to stimulate interest in the area. Four major strategies for reducing material demand through material efficiency are discussed: longer-lasting products; modularisation and remanufacturing; component re-use; designing products with less material. In industrialised nations, these strategies have had little attention, because of economic, regulatory and social barriers, which are each examined. However, evidence from waste management and the pursuit of energy efficiency suggests that these barriers might be overcome, and an outline of potential mechanisms for change is given. In bringing together insights into material efficiency from a wide range of disciplines, the paper presents a set of 20 open questions for future work. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a forecast of certain rare earth flows in Europe at the 2020 horizon, based on an analysis of trends influencing various actors of the rare earth industry along the value chain. While 2020 is indicated as the forecast horizon, the analysis should be considered as more representative of the next decade. The rare earths considered here are used in applications that are important for a low-carbon energy transition and/or have a significant recycling potential: NdFeB magnets (Pr, Nd, Dy), NiMH batteries (Pr, Nd) and fluorescent lamp phosphors (Eu, Tb, Y). An analysis of major trends affecting the rare earth industry in Europe along the value chain (including extraction, separation, fabrication, manufacture, use and recycling), helps to build a scenario for a material flow analysis of these rare earths in Europe. The scenario assumes in particular that during the next decade, there exists a rare earth mine in production in Europe (with Norra K{\"{a}}rr in Sweden as a most likely candidate) and also that recycling is in line with targets proposed in recent European legislation. Results are presented in the form of Sankey diagrams which help visualize the various flows for the three applications. For example, calculations forecast flows from extraction to separation of Pr, Nd and Dy for magnet applications in Europe, on the order of 310 tons, 980 tons and 80 tons rare earth metal resp., while recycled flows are 35 tons, 110 tons and 30 tons resp. Calculations illustrate how the relative contribution of recycling to supply strongly depends on the situation with respect to demand. Considering the balance between supply and demand, it is not anticipated any significant shortage of rare earth supply in Europe at the 2020 horizon, barring any new geopolitical crisis involving China. For some heavy rare earths, supply will in fact largely outweigh demand, as for example Europium due to the phasing out of fluorescent lights by LEDs. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Growing prosperity among its population and an inherent increasing demand for energy complicate China's target of combating climate change, while maintaining its economic growth. This paper, therefore, describes three potential decarbonization pathways to analyze different effects for the electricity, transport, heating, and industrial sectors until 2050. Using an enhanced version of the multi-sectoral, open-source Global Energy System Model, enables us to assess the impact of different CO2 budgets on the upcoming energy system transformation. A detailed provincial resolution allows for the implementation of regional characteristics and disparities within China. Conclusively, we complement the model-based analysis with a quantitative assessment of current barriers for the needed transformation. Results indicate that overall energy system CO2 emissions and in particular coal usage have to be reduced drastically to meet (inter-) national climate targets. Specifically, coal consumption has to decrease by around 60% in 2050 compared to 2015. The current Nationally Determined Contributions proposed by the Chinese government of peaking emissions in 2030 are, therefore, not sufficient to comply with a global CO2 budget in line with the Paris Agreement. Renewable energies, in particular photovoltaics and onshore wind, profit from decreasing costs and can provide a more sustainable and cheaper energy source. Furthermore, increased stakeholder interactions and incentives are needed to mitigate the resistance of local actors against a low-carbon transformation. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s)},

This study develops a methodology to identify critical technology groups for a sustainable low-carbon energy system and evaluates innovation opportunities within those technology groups in Brazil. This method integrates a mixed-integer optimization model (MESSAGE) with more than 300 mapped processes with the technological foresight exercise, creating a novel approach to the innovative technology selection criteria. Findings for Brazil show that fossil fuels will still play an important role, but renewables, like wind energy and biomass together, might reach more than 30% of total electric generation. Moreover, carbon dioxide emissions reductions may exceed 50% in high tax scenarios. The most relevant innovation potential for Brazil occurs in the biomass, wind sectors and in carbon capture in ethanol production. The study points that long-term future is uncertain and decision to invest in innovation is risky and should account for the stage of technological and knowledge development in different countries. The strategy for innovation might, thus, include international partnerships that join efforts and a national development strategy focussing on Brazilian particularities. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The pivotal target of the Paris Agreement is to keep temperature rise well below 2 ◦C above the pre-industrial level and pursue efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5 ◦C. To meet this target, all energy-consuming sectors, including the transport sector, need to be restructured. The transport sector accounted for 19% of the global final energy demand in 2015, of which the vast majority was supplied by fossil fuels (around 31,080 TWh). Fossil-fuel consumption leads to greenhouse gas emissions, which accounted for about 8260 MtCO2eq from the transport sector in 2015. This paper examines the transportation demand that can be expected and how alternative transportation technologies along with new sustainable energy sources can impact the energy demand and emissions trend in the transport sector until 2050. Battery-electric vehicles and fuel-cell electric vehicles are the two most promising technologies for the future on roads. Electric ships and airplanes for shorter distances and hydrogen-based synthetic fuels for longer distances may appear around 2030 onwards to reduce the emissions from the marine and aviation transport modes. The rail mode will remain the least energy-demanding, compared to other transport modes. An ambitious scenario for achieving zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is applied, also demonstrating the very high relevance of direct and indirect electrification of the transport sector. Fossil-fuel demand can be reduced to zero by 2050; however, the electricity demand is projected to rise from 125 TWhel in 2015 to about 51,610 TWhel in 2050, substantially driven by indirect electricity demand for the production of synthetic fuels. While the transportation demand roughly triples from 2015 to 2050, substantial efficiency gains enable an almost stable final energy demand for the transport sector, as a consequence of broad electrification. The overall well-to-wheel efficiency in the transport sector increases from 26% in 2015 to 39% in 2050, resulting in a respective reduction of overall losses from primary energy to mechanical energy in vehicles. Power-to-fuels needed mainly for marine and aviation transport is not a significant burden for overall transport sector efficiency. The primary energy base of the transport sector switches in the next decades from fossil resources to renewable electricity, driven by higher efficiency and sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

China is main producer of several metals and one of their main consumers, which may have implications on their use in other sectors and in low carbon technologies in other countries. We aim at analyzing electricity generation technologies (EGT) in China, their metals requirements, and their global implications. Metals included are Ag, Te, In, Ge, Se, Ga, Cd, Nd, Dy, Pr, Tb, Pb, Cu, Ni, Al, Fe, Cr, and Zn. Dynamic material flow-stock model and seven energy scenarios are used, combined with material scenarios. Results indicates that most critical metals for energy system are Te, Cr, Ag, Ni, In, Ge, Tb, and Dy, however, technology advancements are expected to reduce risks associated with Ag, In, Dy, and Tb. Energy scenarios are difficult to realize without adequate supply of metals from primary sources, combined with increasing resources efficiency, recycling, and careful selection of technologies. Energy models used to produce these scenarios should include energy-material nexus. Biggest global implications expected for Ge, Te, Tb, and Dy. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {We use the concept of Energy Return On energy Invested (EROI) to calculate the amount of the available net energy that can be reasonably expected from World oil liquids during the next decades (till 2040). Our results indicate a decline in the available oil liquids net energy from 2015 to 2040. Such net energy evaluation is used as a starting point to discuss the feasibility of a Renewable Transition (RT). To evaluate the maximum rate of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) development for the RT, we assume that, by 2040, the RES will achieve a power of 11 TW (1012 Watt). In this case, by 2040, between 10 and 20% of net energy from liquid hydrocarbons will be required. Taking into account the oil liquids net energy decay, we calculate the minimum annual rate of RES deployment to compensate it in different scenarios. Our study shows that if we aim at keeping an increase of 3% of net energy per annum, an 8% annual rate of RES deployment is required. Such results point out the urgent necessity of a determined policy at different levels (regional, national and international) favoring the RT implementation in the next decades. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors},

abstract = {Renewables rely heavily on critical materials. Such material (metal)-energy nexus thinking is critical to guarantee global renewable transition. As the largest energy consumer, China aims to promote the unprecedented installation of renewables to significantly decarbonize energy system till 2050. However, the material constraints to those renewable targets have been widely neglected by current stakeholders in China. In this paper, a quantitative framework is proposed to identify and quantify the corresponding material constraints on energy transition from a material cycle perspective. Accordingly, the required critical material demand for China's 2050 renewable transition and its flow, loss, and stock along the life cycle are quantified. It is found that the critical materials (i.e. Cadmium, Tellurium, Indium, Gallium, Selenium, and Germanium) required by solar power in China are all under high shortage and supply risk. Their cumulative demand from 2015 to 2050 will exceeded the present national reserve by 1.4–123-fold. Approximately 804–1056 thousand tons (kt) of Neodymium and 66–85 kt of Dysprosium are required to support the growth of wind power, which account for around 10% with the current reserve in China. Nevertheless, the limited scalability of rare earth production in China may still constrain wind power development. Hence, China should adjust its renewable pathways (e.g. more wind, less solar) based on the critical mineral endowment. Furthermore, recycling is preferred but has limited impact on material criticality mitigation before 2030, and it is then suggested more actions should be made on the international trade and material efficiency improvement along the life cycle to support future renewable needs. {\textcopyright} 2019},

abstract = {In France, significant investments regarding renewable energy power plants will be required in future years in order to attain targets set by French and European regulations. This study aims i) at quantifying the requirements for steel, aluminium, copper (among the most impactful metal productions with respect to climate change in the world) and concrete resulting from the projected energy transition in France by 2050 (with a focus on the power sector) and ii) at estimating the climate change impacts associated with the production of these raw materials. As a basis to the modelling exercise, coefficients of material intensities of electricity generation systems were collected from the literature. Despite the variety of data sources, uncertainties regarding the information gathered on material intensity are of an epistemic nature, reflecting incompleteness. Therefore possibility theory was used to represent uncertainties relative to these parameters and to propagate uncertainty in the calculation. Results are expressed as upper and lower bounds on the probability that requirement for materials, and subsequent climate change impacts of their production, should be lower than a certain value. From these limiting bounds, values are derived for an 80% confidence index and put in perspective with current consumption of raw materials and greenhouse gas emissions of specific French economic activities. In particular, there is a 20% risk that requirements for steel be greater than 46,000 ktonnes (corresponding to 20 years of steel products consumption by the French automotive sector) and for aluminium be greater than 6360 ktonnes (21 years of aluminium consumption by the French building sector). Moreover, there is a 20% risk that the production of steel, copper, aluminium and concrete, as a response to the French energy transition, induces more than 445 million tonnes of CO2-eq. The results provide decision-makers with a basis to decide whether the calculated risks of raw material consumption and corresponding climate change impacts are acceptable, taking into account other types of activities. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The transition to low-carbon mobility could lead to drastic increases in critical mineral requirements risking adverse ecological and societal impacts. Assessments of climate change mitigation potential of new technologies often pay less attention to the criticality of the enabling minerals. We assessed the effects of adopting 4 hybrid architectures on the life-cycle GHG emissions of an emerging fuel and powertrain solution: the use of a novel high-reactivity fuel in an advanced compression-ignition engine (GCI). The 4 hybrids were contrasted against conventional fuels/engines, and a comparable battery electric vehicle using regionally-explicit power mixes in the 3 biggest automotive markets worldwide (China, USA and Europe). The use of larger batteries enabled higher degrees of electrification and it could lead to lower overall emissions. However, there is diminishing returns for every kWh of increasing battery size: a mild hybrid resulted in more than 50% GHG reduction per kWh of battery, whereas an electric vehicle only reduced emission by 4% per kWh given its much larger battery requirement. Given the sustainability constraints of critical raw minerals supply, and the heterogeneity of regional power grids, advanced GCI hybrid architectures, with varying degrees of electrification, can bridge the gap in the interim. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Wind energy is key to addressing the global climate challenge, but its development is subject to potential constraints of finite primary materials. Prior studies on material demand forecasting of wind power development are often limited to a few materials and with low technological resolution, thus hindering a comprehensive understanding of the impact of microengineering parameters on the resource implications of wind energy. In this study, we developed a component-by-component and stock-driven prospective material flow analysis model and used bottom-up data on engineering parameters and wind power capacities to characterize the materials demand and secondary supply potentials of wind energy development in Denmark, a pioneering and leading country in wind power. We also explicitly addressed the uncertainties in the prospective modeling by the means of statistical estimation and sensitivity analysis methods. Our results reveal increasing challenges of materials provision and end-of-life (EoL) management in Denmark's ambitious transition toward 100% renewable energy in the next decades. Harnessing potential secondary resource supply from EoL and extending lifetime could curtail the primary material demand, but they could not fully alleviate the material supply risk. Such a model framework that considers bottom-up engineering parameters with increased precision could be applied to other emerging technologies and help reveal synergies and trade-offs of relevant resource, energy, and climate strategies in the future renewable energy and climate transition. {\textcopyright} 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries, as the essential technology for global energy transition, require the combined support of several metallic resources and the complicated supply chains that follow. The risk of supply disruptions to these resources has been widely observed and measured. However, system boundaries of previous studies were conventionally limited to the mine stage. Possible supply risks inherent in the downstream processing stages were not adequately taken into account. To fill this gap, we generalize the idea of supply risk to the whole supply chain to describe the comprehensive threats for the steady consumption of lithium-ion batteries. Based on such concept, this study assesses the risks of the lithium-ion battery related materials in the three major stages of the entire supply chain: mining, refining and manufacturing. Results indicate that lithium and cobalt are the most critical materials for lithium-ion battery industry. Risks hidden in the downstream stages of nickel and manganese should also not be overlooked. We further argue that for important energy-related materials with complicated supply chains, the risks should be identified and safeguarded comprehensively throughout the entire supply chain. Such work calls for further database establishment and analysis. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The transition to full electromobility must be carefully evaluated, as large amounts of strategic metals will be required, for which there is presently little to no recovery or recycling (e.g. gold, silver, tantalum or cobalt). In this study, we perform a comprehensive metal assessment of two passenger cars (conventional and battery electric models) in terms of mass and thermodynamic rarity. Thermodynamic rarity is based on the property of exergy and is defined as “the amount of exergy resources needed to obtain a mineral commodity from average crustal concentration using the best available technology” (measured in kJ). Thus, the thermodynamic rarity approach assigns a greater exergetic value to scarce (understood as having a relative low average crustal concentration) and difficult-to-extract minerals. Of the 60 metals analyzed, almost 50 metals have been identified within the studied cars, representing 800 (conventional) and 1,200 kg (battery electric), showcasing the fact that a car constitutes a “road mine”. Furthermore, given that the technology behind battery electric cars is in development, three generations of Li-ion batteries were analyzed to study the effect on resource use of a metal changing composition over time. Albeit the battery modules of the three generations present a similar mass content (approximately 70 kgs), the thermodynamic rarity decreases from 275 to 100 Gigajoules, due to the reduced proportion of cobalt, which is by far the most exergetic metal within the battery. Additionally, with the thermodynamic rarity approach, the most exergy intensive parts within a battery electric car have been identified – the high-voltage battery modules, the electric drive, the power module, the charger, the electrical air conditioning compressor and the electromechanical brake servo – providing an indicator facilitating proactive mid- to long-term ecodesign measures and recycling strategies. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The requirements for neodymium, dysprosium, lithium, and cobalt in power generation, storage and transport technologies until 2050 under six global energy scenarios are assessed. We consider plausible developments in the subtechnology markets for lithium-ion batteries, wind power, and electric motors for road transport. Moreover, we include the uncertainties regarding the specific material content of these subtechnologies and the reserve and resource estimates. Furthermore, the development of the material demand in non-energy sectors is considered. The results show that the material requirements increase with the degree of ambition of the scenarios. The maximum annual primary material demand of the scenarios exceeds current extraction volumes by a factor of 3 to9 (Nd), 7 to 35 (Dy), 12 to 143 (Li), and 2 to 22 (Co). The ratios of cumulative primary material demand to average reserve estimates range from 0.1 to 0.3 (Nd), 0.3 to 1.1 (Dy), 0.7 to 6.5 (Li), and 0.8 to 5.5 (Co). Average resource estimates of Li and Co are exceeded by up to a factor of 2.1 and 1.7, respectively. We recommend that future scenario studies on the energy system transformation consider the influence of possible material bottlenecks on technology prices and substitution technology options. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases with a dominant share of coal-fired power, China is expecting a continuous clean power transition in the next decades. However, the development of power generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure requires significant amount of construction materials, therefore an understanding of the corresponding materials demand and waste generation would be important. In this paper, we deployed a dynamic, bottom-up, and technology-specific material flow analysis approach to characterize the stocks and flows of four major construction materials (cement, steel, aluminum, and copper) associated with China's power infrastructure development from 1980 to 2050. We found that the material stocks of China's power infrastructure have increased from 30 ± 4 Mt in 1980 to 573 ± 91 Mt in 2018 (an annual growth rate of 7.7%) and will further increase to 1188 Mt and 1487 Mt in 2050, respectively, in the two energy development scenarios we constructed. While thermal and hydro power contributed the most to stocks growth in the past two decades, solar and wind power are expected to contribute more in the future. A more metal-intensive energy future is foreseen due to increasing use of steel and aluminum in renewable energy generation and use of copper and aluminum in power transmission and distribution. These patterns reflect the physical material basis of China's power transition and call for better understanding of the energy-material nexus for addressing the dual challenge of satisfying growing materials demand and addressing increasing amount of waste and environmental impacts in the next decades. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Wind power needs to be expanded rapidly across the world to stabilize our climate. However, there are increasing concerns about conflicts between the supply of rare-earth elements (REs) (mainly neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium) and the global expansion of wind power. Here, we provide a dynamic, technology-rich, and regional-specific approach to exploring such conflicts among ten world regions through 2050 under four widely recognized climate scenarios. We find that the significant increase in RE demand driven by the ambitious 2050 global wind-power targets cannot be achieved without 11- to 26-fold expansion in the RE production. Material recycling and efficiency, production expansion, and technical innovation are promising for alleviating RE supply shortages in the long term. However, the existing global RE supply structure, along with the intensifying geopolitical and environmental constraints, could inhibit the rapid expansion of wind power, which calls for global cooperation to foster a sustainable and responsible RE supply chain. In 2019, the United Nations called for more ambitious climate action to prevent catastrophic climate change. Decarbonizing our energy systems is one of the most important actions we can take. In response, many countries have developed ambitious plans to expand wind power. However, wind turbines heavily rely on rare-earth elements (REs), and it remains unclear whether supply can meet demand. We investigated potential conflicts between RE demand and supply across ten global regions up to 2050 under four widely recognized climate scenarios. We found that RE supply capacity to support ambitious system-wide wind-power development is likely to be hindered by the monopolistic structure of the RE supply chain and intensified geopolitical and environmental constraints, and an 11- to 26-fold increase in production will be necessary to meet ambitious wind-power-expansion targets. To overcome these RE supply challenges, we highlight the importance of facilitating free trade and diversifying RE production via global cooperation. Enhanced climate action is needed, but ambitious global wind-power-expansion targets raise concern regarding potential conflicts between the supply and demand of rare-earth elements (REs). Li et al. explore such conflicts across ten global regions through 2050 under four scenarios. They show that RE supply might not be able to meet ambitious wind-power development given the monopolistic structure of the RE supply chain and escalated geopolitical and environmental constraints. Sustainable and responsible RE supply chains are possible only via global cooperation. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors},

abstract = {Commonly used materials constituting the core components of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), including the balance-of-plant, were classified according to the EU criticality methodology with an additional assessment of hazardousness and price. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) of the materials potentially present in PEMFC systems was performed for 1 g of each material. To demonstrate the importance of appropriate actions at the end of life (EoL) for critical materials, a LCA study of the whole life cycle for a 1-kW PEMFC system and 20,000 operating hours was performed. In addition to the manufacturing phase, four different scenarios of hydrogen production were analyzed. In the EoL phase, recycling was used as a primary strategy, with energy extraction and landfill as the second and third. The environmental impacts for 1 g of material show that platinum group metals and precious metals have by far the largest environmental impact; therefore, it is necessary to pay special attention to these materials in the EoL phase. The LCA results for the 1-kW PEMFC system show that in the manufacturing phase the major environmental impacts come from the fuel cell stack, where the majority of the critical materials are used. Analysis shows that only 0.75 g of platinum in the manufacturing phase contributes, on average, 60% of the total environmental impacts of the manufacturing phase. In the operating phase, environmentally sounder scenarios are the hydrogen production with water electrolysis using hydroelectricity and natural gas reforming. These two scenarios have lower absolute values for the environmental impact indicators, on average, compared with the manufacturing phase of the 1-kW PEMFC system. With proper recycling strategies in the EoL phase for each material, and by paying a lot of attention to the critical materials, the environmental impacts could be reduced, on average, by 37.3% for the manufacturing phase and 23.7% for the entire life cycle of the 1-kW PEMFC system. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

abstract = {Vehicle electrification is expanding worldwide and has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) from the transportation sector. Batteries are a key component of energy storage systems for electric vehicles (EVs), and their integration into EVs can lead to a wide range of possible environmental outcomes. These outcomes depend on factors such as powertrain type, electricity source, charging patterns, and end-of-life management. Given the complexities of battery systems, a framework is needed to systematically evaluate environmental impacts across battery system life cycle stages, from material extraction and production to use in the EV, through the battery's end-of-life. We have developed a set of ten principles to provide practical guidance, metrics, and methods to accelerate environmental improvement of mobile battery applications and facilitate constructive dialogue among designers, suppliers, original equipment manufacturers, and end-of-life managers. The goal of these principles, which should be implemented as a set, is to enhance stewardship and sustainable life cycle management by guiding design, material choice, deployment (including operation and maintenance), and infrastructure planning of battery systems in mobile applications. These principles are applicable to emerging battery technologies (e.g., lithium-ion), and can also enhance the stewardship of existing (e.g., lead-acid) batteries. Case study examples are used to demonstrate the implementation of the principles and highlight the trade-offs between them. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Electrification of the transport sector will support its decarbonization, yet significantly change material requirements. This calls for an integrated modeling approach internalizing metal demand-supply dynamics in low-carbon scenarios to support the Paris agreement on climate change and sustainable material circulation. Here we develop a step toward the integrated simulation of energy-materials scenarios by unifying a stock-flow dynamics model for low-carbon scenarios using linear programming. The modeling framework incorporates lithium supply from both mines and end-of-life (EoL) recycling for projected use in electric vehicles on a global basis. The results show that supply constraints, which could become apparent from around 2030 in the case of current recycling rates (<1%), would impede the deployment of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), leading to the generation of an additional 300 Mt-CO2 of emissions for vehicle operation in 2050. Another important finding is that increasing the recycling rate to 80% could substantially relieve restrictions on the introduction of BEVs without requiring primary supply from natural deposits far beyond historical rates of expansion. While EoL recycling is important from a long-term perspective, an EoL-oriented strategy has little effect on the short/medium-term (such as to 2030) lithium demand-supply balance because of exponential demand growth and long living batteries. Importantly, findings in this study emphasize the necessity of tackling climate change and resource circulation in an integrated manner. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Automobile companies have attempted to achieve a transition of vehicle types from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to new-generation vehicles (NGVs). Many studies have addressed the resource-related issues of vehicles. Despite the significant attention to the potential impacts of resource use in the LCIA narrative, the volume of natural resource exploitation has yet to be fully investigated. In this study, the concept of total material requirement (TMR), which is an indicator for assessing the scale of land disturbance caused by mining activities, was employed to evaluate the natural resource use for gasoline vehicles (GVs), electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Using this approach, the lifecycle TMR of automobiles at the production, operation and maintenance stages was assessed. It was found that NGV production uses more than twice the resources required for GV production. In particular, the production of the traction Li-ion battery accounts for approximately half of the total resource exploitation in the case of EV production due to the use of Cu, and nearly 40% of resource exploitation in the case of FCV production is attributed to the production of fuel cells due to the use of Pt. The inverse trend between lifecycle TMR and CO2, which was observed for each type of vehicle, implies that recent transportation policies, with their focus on environmental implications of emissions, have overlooked the hidden factors associated with resource exploitation. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract = {This article aims to assess the impact of copper availability on the energy transition and to determine whether copper could become critical due to the high copper content of low-carbon technologies compared to conventional technologies. In assessing copper availability through to 2050, we rely on our linear programming world energy-transport model, TIAM-IFPEN. We examine two climate scenarios (2 °C and 4 °C) with two mobility shape, implemented with a recycling chain. The penetration of low-carbon technologies in the transport and energy sectors (electric vehicles and low-carbon power generation technologies) is likely to significantly increase copper demand by 2050. To investigate how tension over copper resources can be reduced in the energy transition context, we consider two public policy drivers: sustainable mobility and recycling practices. Results show that in the most stringent scenario, the cumulative primary copper demand between 2010 and 2050 is found to be 89.4% of the copper resources known in 2010. They also pinpoint the importance of China and Chile in the future evolution of the copper market. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are seen as one of the solutions for the problems facing the transportation sector including pollution problems, climate change, dimensioning of fossil fuel, and energy security. However, EVs rely on materials identified critical due to risks associated with their supply and environmental impacts. This paper aims at analyzing EVs in China, their requirement for 16 materials, and their national and global implications. The analysis is carried out using multi-level dynamic MFA model and 9 scenarios investigating EVs and batteries market share, their materials content and lifetime, and materials recycling. EVs materials impacts on coproduced materials, and energy, water, and CO2 emissions associated with materials production are discussed. Global metals availability is not expected to constraint EVs development in China, while several metals availability in China is expected to limit their growth. Significant increase in most metals production capacity is required. Extending EVs lifetime and using more than one battery reduce risks associated with REEs and increase those associated with other metals. Metals stock in use is expected to be significant compared to current Chinese reserves. EVs development in China has significant implications on resources availability, mainly REEs and graphite, for other world regions and other sectors. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Japan is a nation which is highly dependent on the import of raw materials to supply its manufacturing industry, notable among them copper. When extracting copper from ore, a large amount of energy is required, typically leading to high levels of CO2 emissions due to the fossil fuel-dominated energy mix. Moreover, maintaining security of raw material supply is difficult if imports are the only source utilized. This study examines the environmental and economic impacts of domestic mineral production from the recycling of end-of-life products and deep ocean mining as strategies to reduce CO2 emissions and enhance security of raw material supplies. The results indicate that under the given assumptions, recycling, which is typically considered to be less CO2 intensive, produces higher domestic emissions than current copper processing, although across the whole supply chain shows promise. As the total quantity of domestic resources from deep ocean ores are much smaller than the potential from recycling, it is possible that recycling could become a mainstream supply alternative, while deep ocean mining is more likely to be a niche supply source. Implications of a progressively aging society and flow-on impacts for the recycling sector are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {Minerals and metals are of uttermost importance in our society, and mineral resources on and beneath the deep ocean floor represent a huge potential. Deciding whether mining from the deep ocean floor is financially, environmentally and technologically feasible requires information. Due to great depths and harsh conditions, this information is expensive and time and resource consuming to obtain. It is therefore important to use every piece of data in an optimum way. In this study, data retrieved from images and expert knowledge were used to estimate minimum and maximum nodule abundances at image locations from an area in the Clarion-Clipperton-Zone of the equatorial North East Pacific. From the minimum and maximum values, box cores and the spatial correlation quantified through variogram, a conditional expectation and associated uncertainty were obtained through the Gibbs sampler. The conditional expectation and the uncertainty were used with the assumed certain abundance data from the box cores in a kriging exercise to obtain better informed estimates of the block by block abundance. The quality assessment of the estimations was done based on distance criterion and on kriging quality indicators like the slope of regression and the weight of the mean. From the original image locations, alternative image configurations were tested, and it was shown that such alternatives produce better estimates, without extra costs. Future improvements will focus on improving the estimation of the minimum and the maximum values at image locations. {\textcopyright} 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract = {We analyse how the global material stocks and flows related to the electricity sector may develop towards 2050. We focus on three electricity sub-systems, being generation, transmission and storage and present a model covering both bulk and critical materials such as steel, aluminium and neodymium. Results are based on the second Shared Socio-Economic Pathway scenario, with additional climate policy assumptions based on the IMAGE integrated assessment framework, in combination with dynamic stock modelling and an elaborate review of material intensities. Results show a rapid growth in the demand for most materials in the electricity sector, as a consequence of increased electricity demand and a shift towards renewable electricity technologies, which have higher material intensities and drive the expansion of transmission infrastructure and electricity storage capacity. Under climate policy assumptions, the annual demand for most materials is expected to grow further towards 2050. For neodymium, the annual demand grows by a factor 4.4. Global demand for steel and aluminium in the electricity sector grows by a factor 2 in the baseline or 2.6 in the 2-degree climate policy scenario. We show that the combination of rapid growth of capital stocks and long lifetimes of technologies leads to a mismatch between annual demand and the availability of secondary materials within the electricity sector. This may limit the sector to accomplish circular material flows, especially under climate policy assumptions. We also highlight the potential for electric vehicles to curb some of the material demand related to electricity storage through adoption of vehicle-to-grid services. {\textcopyright} 2020},

abstract = {The production of energy from renewable sources is much more intensive in minerals than that from fossil resources. The scarcity of certain minerals limits the potential for substituting renewable energy for scarce fossil resources. However, minerals can be recycled, while fossil resources cannot. We develop an intertemporal model to study the dynamics of the optimal energy mix in the presence of mineral intensive renewable energy and fossil energy. We analyze energy production when both mineral and fossil resources are scarce, but minerals are recyclable. We show that the greater the recycling rate of minerals, the more the energy mix should rely on renewable energy, and the sooner should investment in renewable capacity take place. We confirm these results even in the presence of other better known factors that affect the optimal schedule of resource use: expected productivity growth in the renewable sector, imperfect substitution between the two sources of energy, convex extraction costs for mineral resources and pollution from the use of fossil resources. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Electronic products are an essential part of modern society, but their importance has perhaps never been as palpable as when the COVID-19 pandemic forced almost every aspect of human interaction to go online. However, the pandemic also revealed that the supply chains that provide crucial raw materials for manufacturing electronics are increasingly vulnerable to social, geopolitical, and technical disruptions. These vulnerabilities are likely to escalate in the future, due to global health crises, natural disasters, and global political instability, all of which will be magnified by looming climate change impacts. This study investigates potential supply chain disruption risks in the electronics sector by applying metrics that capture supply, demand, socio-political, and environmental risks in a multi-criteria framework to almost 40 metals and minerals that provide critical functionality to electronic products. Results illustrate that the material risks varied with the potential nature of the disruption. For example, in scenarios where disruptions led to price volatility or weakening of environmental regulations, highest risks were observed for precious metals such as gold, rhodium, platinum, and palladium. On the other hand, in scenarios where disruptions led to supply pressures or geopolitical tensions, cobalt, gallium, and key rare earth elements exhibited the highest risks. These metals are characterized by energy-intense manufacturing and highly concentrated geographic production, suggesting that recycling and supply chain diversification may alleviate some of the identified risks. The analysis also considers trade-offs that may occur across social, economic, and environmental dimensions. For example, cobalt, a critical component in lithium-ion batteries, has significant social impacts due to production concentration in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Shifting production to other regions may alleviate these risks but introduce new concerns about economic and environmental impacts. {\textcopyright} 2020},

abstract = {Chinese PV industry can be expected to grow rapidly of until 2050, driven by ongoing decarbonization of the energy mix. Such large-scale deployments generate significant increases in metal demand that may induce resource dilemmas. In this study, dynamic material flow analysis is combined with scenario analysis to estimate future metal demand from Chinese PV industry and complemented by a supply risk assessment. It is found that the maximum annual copper and silver demand up to 2050 equals 79.6% and 58.5% of China's annual production in 2019. Similarly, the baseline scenario projects maximum annual demand of Tellurium and Indium corresponding to 598.1% and 161.8% of China's annual production in 2019. Cumulative base metal demand by 2050 for China's PV sector is 17.3–22.8 times that of in 2018, while cumulative silver demand increases by 4.5–6 times from 2018 to 2050. In the baseline scenario, cumulative byproduct metal demand by 2050 is 14–27.3 times larger than in 2018. High annual and cumulative supply pressures indicate not only the general scarcity of base, precious, and byproduct metals but also highlights the importance of building stable trade relationships for future PV developments in China. Two different measures are identified and assessed for reducing short- and long-term supply risks. Prolonging the lifetime from 25 to 30 years can achieve a cumulative metal conservation of 6.7–24.2%, while shorter lifetime will give rise to secondary supply if recycling technologies are implemented. A clean energy shift indicates that metal availability will become an important perspective for assessing energy security, implying that resource constraints should be considered in different planning levels for renewable energy developments. Strong interconnections between energy and metal supply chains indicate that coordination and holistic nexus views are required for achieving simultaneous sustainability in both systems. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {This paper critically reviews and identifies gaps in the methodologies used to analyze the environmental impacts of mineral and metal global supply chains. Of specific focus are assessments of the extraction and production of minerals and metals needed for a low-carbon energy future. Current trends and projections suggest that the future low-carbon energy system will have greater material needs than the current one. Thus, it is important to better understand the full impacts of increased resource extraction to help ensure a sustainable and just transition. This review reveals that existing methodologies are currently insufficient in capturing the full suite of environmental, social, and governance concerns. The copper supply chain is used as a case study to highlight areas that require refined or augmented methodologies, with an in-depth examination of the corporate practices of Freeport-McMoRan, Vale, and BHP. Together, this review of existing methodologies and examples from the copper supply chain highlight the incomplete and variable nature of environmental and climate reporting within the mining industry. Areas for future work are defined with the goal of advancing accounting frameworks for the mining industry and the associated supply chain. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Author(s).

abstract = {Photovoltaic and wind power technologies will continue to play a crucial role in decarbonizing global energy systems in the next decades. Estimations of future material demands usually do not include life cycle material losses in its whole extent. This paper presents results of a screening study on life cycle losses including extraction, manufacturing and both scrap and end-of-life recycling processes for eight materials. Besides, a framework for calculating the future material demand taking into account the whole life cycle material losses is presented. Based on the projections of the “Beyond 2 Degree Scenario” by IEA-ETP 2017, the cumulated demands and annual demands are calculated and compared to geological reserves and annual production capacities, respectively. Results show that total future cumulated demand overshoots current global reserve estimates only for Tellurium, Indium and Selenium. Annual Tellurium, Indium and Gallium production capacities have to be expanded even in low penetration scenarios. Uncertainties of life cycle losses during manufacturing and extraction phases are higher than in both, scrap and end-of-life recycling. Including life cycle losses may increase material demand of the investigated technologies by factors of 15-37 for Ga, In, Pr and Se as well as by factors of 4-5 for Dy, Nd and Te. Including most optimistic assumptions and technological innovations may decrease material intensities by 1-18% for rare earth elements. These findings have implications for analysts that compare technology demand scenarios to reserve or resource figures since excluding life cycle losses is shown to drastically underestimate necessary material extraction. More explicit statistical tools for quantifying material demand under high uncertainties are suggested. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Critical resources are key for low carbon development. International trade in critical resources is commonplace. It is important to clarify country roles within this trade network so that resource supply risk can be mitigated and low carbon industries can be supported. This study investigates global trade of typical ores and chemical compounds for lithium-ion batteries—lithium carbonate, cobalt oxide, nickel sulfate, manganese sulfate, nickel ore and manganese ore. The period 2010–2018 is selected to explore different country roles using network analysis. A competition trade model is developed to identify relationships between countries. A critical resource influence model is developed using bootstrap percolation theory to simulate impacts arising from dominant countries—those countries with rich resource endowments or mature markets. Results show that dominant countries tend to maintain close trade relationships. Trade scale is a key factor influencing each country's trade competitiveness and influence. Several policy recommendations are proposed to promote sustainable resource trade and use. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Solar grade silicon (SoG–Si) is a key material for the development of crystalline silicon photovoltaics (PV), which is expected to reach the tera-watt level in the next years and around 50TW in 2050. Upgraded metallurgical grade silicon (UMG–Si) has already demonstrated to be a viable alternative to standard polysilicon in terms of cost and quality. This study presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of UMG obtained by the FerroSolar process. Moreover, it shows the environmental impacts of PV modules and electricity generation based on this material. For this, an exhaustive review of the life cycle inventory (LCI) of PV value chain, from metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) down to electricity generation, has been carried out updating inputs for all processes. The Balance of System (BoS) has also been updated with current state of the art data for a fixed open ground large PV site (100 MWpk). Two different electricity mixes, with low and high carbon intensities, have been considered. The results reveal that for PV electricity generation using UMG-Si instead of polysilicon leads to an overall reduction of Climate change (CC) emissions of over 20%, along with an improvement of the Energy Payback Time (EPBT) of 25%, achieving significantly low values, 12 gCO2eq/kWhe and 0.52 years, respectively. Moreover, it is shown that UMG silicon feedstock is not the main contributor to the carbon and energy footprint of the produced electricity, leaving the first place to PV module manufacturing. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a dynamic panel threshold model to empirically investigate whether the effects of technological progress on metal consumption in the electricity industry differs by the change of industrial structure upgrading level (INSTRU). We consider a panel data set including 41 countries over the period 2000–2016. The estimated results suggests 2.72, 2.39 and 2.84 as the average threshold parameters of INSTRU for basic ferrous metals (Iron and Chromium), basic non-ferrous metals (Aluminium, Copper and Nickel) and critical metals (Indium, Neodymium and Dysprosium) respectively. When INSTRU is lower than the corresponding threshold, domestic technological progress (LnSRD) and foreign technological spillover progress (LnSIM) significantly promote the consumption of the above-mentioned metals. However, when INSTRU is higher than the corresponding threshold, LnSRD and LnSRD will reduce the consumption of basic ferrous metals such as Iron and Chromium, but will continue to increase the consumption of critical metals such as Indium, Neodymium and Dysprosium. Last, we confirm that LnSRD play a more important role in changing metal consumption structure in the electricity industry than that of LnSIM. These findings are of great significance to government policies that ensure the transition to low-carbon electricity systems. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Concerns over anthropogenic climate change and sustainable development motivate rapid expansion of renewable energy in China. This paper explores metal demand caused by projected wind power developments in China up to 2050. Dynamic material flow analysis is combined with explorative energy scenarios to evaluate induced demand of base metals (copper, steel, aluminum, nickel) and rare earth elements (neodymium and dysprosium). The results indicate that annual demand of base metals for Chinese wind power is up to 12 times larger in 2050 than in 2018, and the cumulative demand is up to 23 times larger. Copper and nickel show greater supply pressure than aluminum and steel in the wind power sector. Cumulative copper and nickel demand of wind power sector are 9–11.9 Mt and 2.1–2.8 Mt respectively, which corresponds to 35–45.9% of copper reserves and 74–101% of nickel reserves in China. For rare earth elements demand, more than 18-fold increases are expected for annual demand in 2050 compared with 2020, and cumulative demand of neodymium and dysprosium are 1.6–3.3% and 1.4–2.8% of their reserves respectively. Recycling will play an important role after 2050 as a secondary supply of metal for Chinese wind power, and lacks noteworthy impacts on short-term future outlooks. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {To limit global warming well below 2 °C, or even 1.5 °C, a rapid transition toward renewable energies must occur within the next several decades. This study examines the problem of resource constraints in the development of clean energy and transportation technologies (namely wind turbines and batteries in electric vehicles) for different global energy-consumption scenarios. For this study, lithium and cobalt (demand from electric vehicles) and neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium (cumulative demand from electric vehicles and wind power) were considered as critical materials. The application of simple dynamic models allows for an integrated assessment, taking into account changes in energy demand, resource intensity of wind energy and electric vehicles, and exploration and recycling technologies. The obtained results show that, irrespective of the considered scenario or the method used for estimating rare-earth element reserves, the demand for neodymium and praseodymium remains within a maximum of 12%–14% of the total reserves even when the development in recycling technologies is not considered. Meanwhile, the demand for dysprosium is much more significant at 86% in the absence of recycling technologies. There are strong indicators that clean-energy development can be threatened by the shortage of cobalt and lithium by the middle of this century unless we achieve rapid progress in technologies related to their exploration and reuse. {\textcopyright} 2021},

abstract = {During the last years, the industry directly involved in the production and transformation of mineral raw materials in the EU has been responsible for ca. 40% of the value added associated with downstream manufacturing sectors, engaging more than 3 million of job positions. However, the EU is a net importer of ores along with a large diversity of metals and other mineral-derived products, including many of those involved in high-technology applications. This dependency makes the EU economy quite vulnerable to supply disruptions or other market fluctuations impacting the global supply chain for mineral raw materials. Ultimately, persistent shortages in supply represent serious bottlenecks to various economic activities running in the EU, jeopardising a significant number of jobs and many lines of the political agenda for the intended model of sustainable development. To overcome this potential weakness, a European mineral-based value chain emerges as a logical solution, particularly if designed along with a coherent scenario of re-industrialisation, research and development, technological innovation, continuous training of a high-qualified workforce, and internal investments prioritisation. In this context, the existing interlinks between activities related to the mining life cycle and the product life cycle in the EU must be revisited and transformed. The main drivers for these changes are (i) technological advances related to accelerated transitions towards digitisation, automation, and a low-carbon economy; (ii) societal, requiring higher fairness and increasing levels of transparency and proficiency from both the authorities and industry players; and (iii) relieving the reliance on imports of critical mineral raw materials. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {The present work aims to identify critical materials in water electrolysers with potential future supply constraints. The expected rise in demand for green hydrogen as well as the respective implications on material availability are assessed by conducting a case study for Germany. Furthermore, the recycling of end-of-life (EoL) electrolysers is evaluated concerning its potential in ensuring the sustainable supply of the considered materials. As critical materials bear the risk of raising production costs of electrolysers substantially, this article examines the readiness of this technology for industrialisation from a material perspective. Except for titanium, the indicators for each assessed material are scored with a moderate to high (platinum) or mostly high (iridium, scandium and yttrium) supply risk. Hence, the availability of these materials bears the risk of hampering the scale-up of electrolysis capacity. Although conventional recycling pathways for platinum, iridium and titanium already exist, secondary material from EoL electrolysers will not reduce the dependence on primary resources significantly within the period under consideration—from 2020 until 2050. Notably, the materials identified as critical are used in PEM and high temperature electrolysis, whereas materials in alkaline electrolysis are not exposed to significant supply risks. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {The accelerating pace of energy use transition towards renewable energy worldwide has triggered the amplification of the demand for rare earths. This paper aims to explore the risk transfer between renewable energy and rare earth markets from the perspective of firms. The intention is motivated by the observation that significant investments regarding renewable energy are projected for the future and rare earths have emerged as an investment vehicle. By applying the DY (Diebold and Yilmaz) index onto high-frequency data, this paper sheds light on the connectedness between new energy and rare earth markets at firm level. Empirical results show that moderate volatility spillovers exist between these two markets in China. The risk transfer between firms in renewable energy and rare earth markets is also delineated in the form of network connectedness. The magnitude of risk transfer among firms may alter and the structure of risk transfer has seen shifts of focuses among firms over time. Furthermore, using the method of spillover asymmetric measure, pessimistic mood is detected in both markets during most of the period from 2012 to 2020, which indicates a lack of confidence and efficiency in the financing channel of stock. Compared with the existing literature, this article provides a finance-oriented exploration between these two markets using high-frequency data and a detailed illustration at firm level, which may help inform the decision-making for stakeholders. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Sustainable development embraces a broad spectrum of social, economic and ecological aspects. Thus, a sustainable transformation process of energy systems is inevitably multidimensional and needs to go beyond climate impact and cost considerations. An approach for an integrated and interdisciplinary sustainability assessment of energy system transformation pathways is presented here. It first integrates energy system modeling with a multidimensional impact assessment that focuses on life cycle-based environmental and macroeconomic impacts. Then, stakeholders' preferences with respect to defined sustainability indicators are inquired, which are finally integrated into a comparative scenario evaluation through a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), all in one consistent assessment framework. As an illustrative example, this holistic approach is applied to the sustainability assessment of ten different transformation strategies for Germany. Applying multi-criteria decision analysis reveals that both ambitious (80%) and highly ambitious (95%) carbon reduction scenarios can achieve top sustainability ranks, depending on the underlying energy transformation pathways and respective scores in other sustainability dimensions. Furthermore, this research highlights an increasingly dominant contribution of energy systems' upstream chains on total environmental impacts, reveals rather small differences in macroeconomic effects between different scenarios and identifies the transition among societal segments and climate impact minimization as the most important stakeholder preferences. {\textcopyright} 2021 by the authors.

abstract = {Electric vehicles and electricity storage systems are major pillars in the German energy transition process towards a renewable energy system. Although both technologies are commonly found in future energy system scenarios, the aspect of resource availability as well as their extended implication on the environment and national economy for battery systems remains uncertain. Therefore, this paper assesses the total cumulated metal demand for Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) in Germany by 2050, based on two distinct battery market scenarios. A multidimensional criticality assessment was conducted to evaluate possible risk implications for Germany concerning the security of supply, the economic vulnerability and environmental impacts. Herein, the perspective of a fair distribution of global resources, determined by the German share of the global population, was applied. We find that supply bottlenecks are to be expected especially for lithium, nickel, and cobalt, as the German demand exceeds its dedicated resource budget. Depending on the market development scenarios, the resource budget of most of the metals for the use in LiBs will be depleted between 2025 and 2030. The vulnerability of the German economy to supply restrictions of related metals is high mainly due to the lack of substitutes, high import reliance as well as a considerable contribution to the national GDP. The evaluation of several mitigation strategies showed that it is possible to significantly reduce the severity of the risks. Effective support schemes and regulations are required to ensure that efficiency measures such as development of novel battery concepts, improved material efficiency in production as well as establishment of effective recycling processes must be implemented without delay. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Funding text 2: As for other batteries such as NiMH, LMO and NCA batteries, they will either be obsolete or have only a minimal market share in Germany by 2050. NiMH batteries should be completely phased out by 2020 at the latest. This assumption is supported by the fact that Toyota has recently started offering its Prius hybrid model as an NMC variant, thus following the trend towards market-wide substitution of NiMH by NMCs (Cui and Xiao, 2018). While LMO technologies score points with a price advantage, manufacturers have already switched to the use of NMC technologies (Azevedo et al., 2018), which is why a market withdrawal is expected at the latest by 2030. With regard to the NCA battery, the future development is subject to uncertainties. It can be said that although Tesla's NCA performance has gained attention in recent years, the interest in research and development projects focusing on NMC is generally higher. In addition, the high cobalt content indicates that NMC material reductions are a cost and benefit specific optimal choice. NCA is therefore only a small player in the German market for BEV applications in passenger cars. All the above trends are reflected in the design of the conservative and innovative battery market scenarios for EV batteries, which are shown in Fig. 2. The market developments of HEVs are not presented as they are expected to phase out completely by 2030. The market developments of fuel cells powered EVs are provided in Figure E1-2 in Appendix E.},

Using daily data from 25 March 2010 to 25 August 2020, a quantile-based connectedness approach is applied to uncover both average and tail-based connectedness while considering the full sample period and the COVID-19 pandemic days. The results suggest that the interdependence among these indexes changes dramatically at the lower and upper quantiles, suggesting a strong influence of extreme market scenarios on both returns and volatility connectedness dynamics. Higher integration of sectoral indexes is observed during 2010–2012 and the COVID-19 pandemic period. Health care and telecommunication indexes have been consistent transmitters of return and volatility spillovers to other indexes during the full sample period. Consumer electronics and clean technology indexes switch their roles from a net receiver to a net transmitter during pandemic days. The rare earth remains on the recipient's side consistently. The findings indicate that the ongoing U.S.–China trade embargo has not impacted the return and volatility dynamics of the five sectoral indexes superseding the demand-driven dynamics for rare earth. {\textcopyright} 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract = {This study presents a socially sustainable energy system narrative that is based on two pillars: energy sufficiency as the universal energy system goal and the energy-justice-based principles of energy access provision. The constructed narrative provides an operational theoretical foundation for choosing energy provision technologies that can be considered socially sustainable and offers an alternative to prioritizing the cost-minimization mindset. Through a case of household electricity provision in Sub-Saharan Africa, the narrative is applied as a set of theoretical assumptions for energy system modelling. The presented model explores to what extent different combinations of centralized, decentralized, fossil-fuel-based and renewables-based electricity access provision are compatible with the principles of socially sustainable energy system design. Comparing three different scenarios of electricity access provision using centralized and decentralized fossil-fuel-based and renewables-based electricity generation technologies, this study concludes that decentralized and renewables-based electricity generation mixes are associated with higher cost but also with greater social sustainability benefits. By combining a conceptual narrative of socially sustainable energy systems with system dynamics modelling, theoretical work on sustainable energy system development is bridged with the energy system modelling practice. The research design of this study may interest scholars working on the theoretical development of sustainable energy system principles and their application in modelling as well as energy system modellers. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Increasing demand for metals used in clean energy technologies, including electric vehicles, has led to an increased demand in certain metals such as Ni, Co, and Mn. This demand has in turn led to an expanding interest in deep-seabed mining (DSM) of polymetallic nodule deposits that contain these exact metals. The main concerns about DSM relate to the incomplete information available about the environmental risks associated with seabed mineral extraction. Key uncertainties need to be systematically addressed to refine environmental impact predictions and establish effective mitigation measures. Adaptive management is an iterative process for reducing the uncertainty that can be applied by both mining companies and regulatory bodies. This Special Series paper reviews the key opportunities and challenges to operationalizing adaptive management in DSM projects and highlights the need for a framework to move from theory to practice. The discussion proposes a systems approach to adaptive management, which could help to guide the environmental management of deep-sea mineral extraction.

abstract = {In response to climate change and continued reliance on traditional high-carbon fossil fuels, promoting the transition toward sustainable energy systems by development of low-carbon energy resources has been seen as the main strategy for mitigating and solving global climate change. However, the promotion of low-carbon energy also faces material supply risks. To provide a reference for the steady and rapid development of renewable energy and other energy in the future energy market, this paper considers renewable energy prediction based on a long- and short-term memory network model as well as the growth rate changes of crude oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, financial revenues, and expenditure. In the prediction process, it is found that natural gas will be a strong competitor for the development of renewable energy in the future. When natural gas grows too quickly, the growth of renewable energy will be negative. On the other hand, when the monthly growth rate of natural gas and crude oil is smaller than that of nuclear energy, renewable energy will display a growth trend, and the rate will increase with the growth of natural gas and nuclear energy. What is more, wind and solar energy will be limited by metallic materials, such as Dy, Nd, Te, and In. Improving the energy density of metals plays a key role in China's transition to a low-carbon energy structure. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 Liu, Chen, Wang and Wang.},

abstract = {Thin film photovoltaic technologies are playing an increasingly important role in the transition to a low carbon economy. Their extensive deployment will require large amounts of raw materials, especially those of companion metals. Concerns about whether the availability of materials will impede the development of low-carbon technologies have led to growing research in resource criticality. However, previous studies on criticality generally provide only static assessment models and pay little attention to the difference between base metals and companion metals. This article makes an attempt to dynamically evaluate the long-term criticalities of companion metals at a global level by combining the supply risk and impact of supply disruption. The results highlight germanium and indium as the elements with the highest criticality; tellurium and selenium exhibit a relatively moderate criticality while gallium and cadmium show very low criticality. The findings will offer proper guidance for stakeholders to address supply shortages in advance and encourage thin film technologies development. Priority measures for high criticality materials are discussed to alleviate the supply disruption potential, such as strategic stockpiling, implementing fixed-price contracts, increasing by-product recovery and secondary supply, material substitution and strengthening global mining. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Clean energy technologies represent a promising solution to the global warming challenge. However, many of them depend on some minor metals, and concerns about their rapidly increasing demand have been raised recently. Since minor metals are produced along with other materials, called base metals, they are also referred as by-product materials. With this characteristic, their production quantities rely on the production quantities of the base metals. Therefore, the production decisions for the by-product materials are not easy, and the decisions become even more complex under competitive market. This research seeks to find equilibrium production quantities of both base and by-product materials using Cournot model. Then, the model is applied to a case study of indium, which is critical for two emerging clean energy technologies, thin-film solar photovoltaic and light emitting diode lighting. The numerical analysis in the case study suggests some meaningful insights in this market, and the equilibrium production quantities are also compared with the optimal production quantity under monopoly market condition. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

@article{Birat2020,
abstract = {After overusing the expression Sustainable Development, some action plan was needed to switch from rhetorical to transformational change. One of the answers was to propose the word Transition as a roadmap leading to the necessary level of change. A Transition is a passage from one stable regime to another, with a step that is neither instantaneous nor dangerous, like a Revolution, but is fast enough, anyway. The first Transition in the 2010s was the Energy Transition, i.e. a move towards less fossil fuels and more renewables. It started everywhere more or less at the same time, but Germany and its Energiewende was among the first contenders. The implicit objective was as much to control excessive anthropogenic GHG emissions as it was to possibly start a new period of growth based on green technologies. Very soon, however, the Fukushima disaster convinced Mrs. Merkel to change tack and veer towards "zero nuclear power", thus aligning with the program of the Green movements. At that point, the Energiewende had become a complex, multi-objectives program for change, not a simple Transition as described at the onset of the paper. The rest of the world turned to Globish and spoke of the Energy Transition (EnT). Each country added a layer of complexity to its own version of the EnT and told a series of narratives, quite different from each other. This is analyzed in the present article on the basis of the documents prepared by the "energy-community", which assembles hard scientists and economists, a group that the soft scientists of SSH call STEM. EnT, in its most recent and mature version, hardly speaks of energy any more but of GHG emissions. Therefore, EnT drifted towards the expression Ecological Transition (EcT). Both expressions are almost synonymous today. From then on, myriads similar expressions sprang up: Environmental Transition, Demographic, Epidemiological and Environmental Risk Transition, Societal Transitions, Global Transitions, Economic Transition, Sustainability Transition, Socio-Ecological Transitions, Technology Transitions, Nutrition Transition, Agro-Ecological Transition, Digital Transition, Sanitary Transition as well as various practices like Energy Democracy or Theory of Transition. Focusing only on EnT and EcT, a first step consists in comparing energy technologies from the standpoint of their impact on public health: thus, coal is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude worse than renewable energy, not to speak of nuclear. A second step looks at the materials requirement of Renewables, what has been called the materials paradox. They are more materials-intensive and also call on much larger TMRs (Total Materials Requirement). On the other hand, the matter of critical materials has been blown out of proportion and is probably less out of control than initially depicted. A third step is accomplished by Historians, who show that History is full of energy transitions, which did not always go in one direction and did not always match the storytelling of progress that the present EnT is heavily relying on. Moreover, they flatly reject the long-term storytelling of History depicted as a continuous string of energy transitions, from biomass, to coal, oil, gas, nuclear and nowadays renewables. Just as interesting is the opinion of the Energy-SSH community. They complain that the organizations that control research funds and decision makers listen mainly to the STEM-energy community rather than to them. And they go on to explain, sometimes demonstrate, that this restricts the perspective, over-focuses on certain technologies and confines SSH to an ancillary role in support of projects, the strategy of which is decided without their input: the keyword is asymmetry of information, which therefore leads to distortion of decision-making. They also stress the need for a plurality of views and interpretations, a possible solution to the societal deadlocks often encountered in Europe. As important and strategic as energy issues are in our present world, the hubris of both STEM and SSH communities may be excessive. Some level of success in making them work together may be a way to resolve this situation! {\textcopyright} SCF, 2021.},

@article{Hancock2019,
abstract = {This research aimed to construct a framework to guide policy decisionmaking for climate compatible resilient energy systems, appropriate for countries prone to disasters. It followed a method based on a literature review and the applied example of India. Part I of the framework comprised a snap-shot of a country or regional energy source mix, an overview of energy policies/politics and an outline of the challenges of RE and policy design for more resilient energy systems in disaster-prone regions. Using secondary analysis of official Indian energy system data, the research demonstrated the challenges of energy transitions for a developing country highly dependent on fossil fuels. Part II further developed key elements of the framework, structured around key concepts of climate compatible critical infrastructure, technology based on ethical materials choices used in energy generation devices and energy systems, development of disaster risk resilience (DRR), governance and public policy analytical lenses for design of climate compatible resilient disaster energy systems, and finally, identification of criteria for assessing the ongoing sustainability of energy systems. The framework was designed to assist policy makers by laying out steps to address the proactive design of disaster and climate change compatible energy systems and critical infrastructure. {\textcopyright} 2019 L & H Scientific Publishing, LLC.},
