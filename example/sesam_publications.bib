abstract = {The production of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from natural gas reservoirs with high content of acidic compounds is expected to be a strategic and crucial issue for the development of the natural gas market in future decades. Therefore, the identification of alternative suitable processes for the synergistic natural gas purification and LNG production, when the amount of CO2 in the raw gas feed is high, and their comparative thermodynamic assessment, is necessary to foster a cleaner and efficient production of LNG. In this paper, the energy intensity of the classical chemical absorption units using aqueous solutions of Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and the novel Dual Pressure Low-Temperature Distillation process (DPD) operating in different national contexts is assessed by means of the Net Equivalent Methane analysis and the Energy Life Cycle Assessment. These methods return respectively the equivalent methane and the embodied non-renewable energy invoked by the two alternative processes in one operating year. In general, the primary energy required by the construction phases of both the systems results negligible compared to the operation phase, and most of the latter is due to the consumption of energy utilities, which is strongly dependent by the considered national context. According to the results obtained by means of both the methodologies, the DPD process is generally less energy intensive compared to MDEA: the DPD process results to be an efficient and promising technique to perform the synergistic natural gas purification and LNG production.},

abstract = {In this paper, a hybrid tri-generation system is designed to produce LNG and freshwater simultaneously based on a multi-effect desalination system and analyzed using energy and exergy analyses. For natural gas liquefaction, the initially required cooling of the cycle is supplied by ammonia-water absorption system, and the required intermediate cooling load and liquefaction process are provided by a refrigeration system with mixed fluid. Two alternatives for providing power generation to the system and the required heat for driving the absorption cycle have been considered and compared. The first alternative relies on a natural-gas-fired power plant, while the second is based on steam-solar power plant with dish collectors. The former results in the total energy efficiency of 85.8% (LHV). The highest thermodynamic irreversibilities occur in the heat exchangers (61%), even if they have the highest exergy efficiency compared to the other plant equipment. On the other hand, using solar dish collectors enables to decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 40%, and increases freshwater and LNG production by 95% and 4.7% respectively. The power obtained per kg of LNG produced is about 0.19 kWh, which is less than or equal to the other similar patents. The results of the economic analysis with the annualized cost method of the system show that the products prime cost of both structures 1 and 2 are equal to 0.2580 and 0.1784 US$ per kg of LNG, respectively. A suitable strategy for modelling enhancement of system's parameters is suggested by expanding of sensitivity analysis on the important parameters of the developed system.},

This article proposes an approach to a thorough assessment of the impact of efficiency policies on final energy uses, focusing on residential space heating and cooling, and capable of: (1) quantifying final useful services provided and (2) accounting for the global impact of efficiency policies on final energy use, taking advantage of Input-Output analysis. This approach is applied in five cities of Argentina. Firstly, the quantity of energy service provided (i.e., level of thermal comfort) for each city is evaluated and compared with the defined target. It is found out that heating comfort is guaranteed approximately as established, whereas in the cooling case the provision is twice the established level. Secondly, primary energy consumption of heating and cooling services is evaluated before and after different efficiency improvement policies. The results show that the major primary energy saving (52%) is obtained from the upgrading appliances scenario and reflect the importance of accounting for embodied energy in goods and services involved in interventions.},

abstract = {The assessment of the prospective, economy-wide, economic and environmental impact of large-scale policy shocks is currently performed via general equilibrium models, relying on background input–output data usually characterized by a very aggregated definition of the energy conversion chain. Thus, such models are not always able to properly assess the impact of policy shocks on the energy conversion chain. On the other hand, empirical models based on physical data provide a detailed picture of the energy conversion chain but are unable to comprehensively address energy-economy interactions. This paper introduces an approach to analyze the impact of large-scale policy shocks with special focus on international trade and global energy conversion chains. The approach relies upon an empirical meso-economic equilibrium model and a physical supply and use model of the energy conversion chain. The link between the models is provided by the Multi-Factor Energy Input-Output model. The proposed approach is formalized and applied to assess the economic and energy impact of different Brexit scenarios, returning the related impact in terms of changes in value added generation, change in production of energy carriers and change in energy-related CO2 emissions. It is found that a highly disaggregated picture of the energy supply chain provides fundamental insights to assess the physical viability of economic scenarios. Therefore, the proposed method reveals important synergies that may arise from the joint application of the economic and physical models, hence becoming a suitable candidate to provide insights and guidance for policy making.},

abstract = {In this research, a novel integration of a downdraft gasifier, an externally fired gas turbine, a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and a cryogenic CO2 separation unit is developed. The exhaust air flow from the gas turbine is completely recirculated to the combustion chamber to utilize the air's high-temperature potential as the oxidizer in the syngas combustion. Produced hot gasses flow into the hot temperature heat exchanger (HTHE) to raise the compressed air temperature up to the gas turbine inlet temperature. Besides this, the MCFC unit is utilized both for producing additional power for the retrofitting CO2 separation unit. Finally, a cryogenic separation unit has been utilized for liquid CO2 production and for recovering H2 and CO from the fuel cell anode exhausts. Detailed exergy and exergoeconomic analyses have performed on the developed thermodynamic model, including a parametric analysis on critical design parameters. The overall exergy efficiency of the system results as 40.76%, the LCOE results as 77.74 USD/MWh, and specific CO2 emission results as 133.3 kgCO2/kWh. Results of the exergoeconomic analysis indicate the gasifier and the combustion chamber are identified as the components with the highest exergy destruction rates (20.18% and 15.54% with respect to the total). Exergoeconomic analysis allows to identify strategies for improving the system, focusing on the heat recovery unit (HRU) and the MCFC as the components with lowest and highest values of the exergoeconomic factor (0.47% and 96.39%), respectively due to high thermodynamic inefficiencies and high investment cost.},

Among the existing modelling tools, some have been widely used to engage policy makers, due to their open source and basic structure. Yet, in the attempt of simplifying the representation of integrated systems, essential features significantly influencing the dynamics between systems may have been left aside. This study proposes an improved formulation of the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS), for a better representation of energy and resource storage processes. In particular, the focus of this work is the storage losses introduction for both dams for hydropower generation and batteries for electricity storage. The modifications were applied to a case study representing key features of both a developed and developing country. The results highlight that, with low additional computational effort, a much more accurate representation of the storage technologies can be achieved. Despite the introduction of losses, renewable energy technologies tend to have a high penetration in the future energy mix thanks to storage applications that remedy their unpredictability and seasonality.},

abstract = {Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) system is emerging as a promising technology to support the development of low carbon power systems. In this context, the present research proposes two scenarios to obtain a biomass-fueled power plant with limited CO2 emissions. A novel combination of a downdraft gasifier (DG), internally fired gas turbine, Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC), Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), and cryogenic separation unit, is proposed (named scenario 1) and it is compared to a system in which a bottoming steam cycle (SBC) was used instead of the ORC (named scenario 2). To have a deeper insight into the performance of the integrations, a sensitivity analysis and comparative study have been developed in this research in terms of their thermodynamic and economic performance. Sensitivity analysis explores the effects of significant variables on the proposed system performance: fuel cell current density, fuel cell steam to carbon ratio, gas turbine inlet temperature, and CO2 and fuel utilization factors. Exergy and exergoeconomic analyses reveal that the air-preheater in scenario 1 and gasifier in scenario 2 are identified as the component with maximum exergy destruction rate (21% and 14% of total respectively) and HRU in scenario 1 and SBC condenser have the lowest value of the exergoeconomic factor (3.76% and 0.01% respectively) due to high thermodynamic inefficiencies, while MCFC in both scenarios has the highest exergoeconomic factor 87.29% and 80.67% respectively due to its high investment cost. Also, scenario 1 achieves the amount of 83.86 (USD/MWeh) for LCOE that is 55.76 (USD/MWeh) more than the reference case and 3.55 (USD/MWeh) less than the scenario 2.},

abstract = {The standard ISO 14044:2006 defines the hierarchical steps to follow when solving multifunctionality issues in life cycle assessment (LCA). However, the practical implementation of such a hierarchy has been debated for twenty-five years leading to different implementation practices from LCA practitioners. The first part of this study discussed the main steps where the ISO hierarchy has been implemented differently and explored current multifunctionality practices in peer-reviewed studies. A text-mining process was applied to quantitatively assess such practices in the 532 multifunctional case studies found in the literature. In the second part of the study, citation network analysis (CNA) was used to identify the major publications that influenced the development of the multifunctionality-debate in LCA, i.e., the key-route main path. The identified publications were then reviewed to detect the origins of the different practices and their underlying theories. Based on these insights, this study provided some "food for thought"on current practices to move towards consistent methodology. We believe that such an advancement is urgently needed for better positioning LCA as a tool for sustainability decision-making. In particular, consistent allocation practices could be especially beneficial in bioeconomy sectors, where production processes are usually multifunctional, and where current allocation practices are not harmonized yet.},

abstract = {In light of a national policy aiming at satisfying a growing demand for electricity, while achieving a greater diversification of power generation technologies and full electrification by 2050, this research models and contrasts alternative electrification pathways for Tanzania in the time frame 2015–2040. The study relies on an improved model grounded on the OSeMOSYS framework. GIS data are used both to determine the electricity demand projections and to inform the decision about the optimal production technologies made by OSeMOSYS with a least-cost criterion. Findings indicate that the stated policy goals (New Policy scenario) are within reach, but they also imply an increase in installed capacity from less than 2 GW to at least 13.8 GW, corresponding to an investment of 25.3 billion USD, which is significantly above historical spending in the power sector. Also, only an additional environmental policy (450TZ scenario) would ensure that the carbon intensity of the power sector lowers from a current 440 gCO2/kWh to around 100 gCO2/kWh in 2040, with the additional benefit of a lower average cost of providing electricity (compared to the New Policy scenario). An Energy For All scenario where universal access is achieved two decades earlier (in 2030) is also feasible but implies more difficulties in lowering carbon intensity or the cost of providing electricity. Results for universal access are the object of a separate in-depth discussion and a sensitivity analysis looks at the effect of key assumption (e.g., on demand projections and discount rate) on the main results.},

Among these, photovoltaic (PV) driven heat pumps are the most competitive solutions from a techno-economic viewpoint. This study aims to quantify and assess the environmental benefits of the aforementioned solution by conducting a Life Cycle Assessment in comparison to different conventional heating and cooling alternatives, including separate production of electricity and heat, grid connected heat pumps and solar absorption systems. An average residential building of 100 m2 located in Milan, Italy, is selected as case study. The equivalent CO₂ emissions from the PV driven heat pumps are estimated to be 71.8 kg/MWh, while the respective emissions of a solar absorption system are estimated to be 150.4 kg/MWh. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is conducted to analyze the effect on the overall environmental performance of different key parameters, including the system's location during the use phase and the number of the used PV panels. Results indicate that CO₂ equivalent emissions in Trapani, where the best performance in global warming is presented, are lower by 57% compared to Bolzano which presents the worst performance. On the other hand, the number of installed PV panels reaches an optimal value beyond which the benefits of the excess of electricity production are counter-balanced by the added footprint by the manufacturing and end-of-life footprints. It was found that the 4 PVs system has a reduced impact by 57% in global warming, compared to the conventional heat pump, while the impact is lower only by 1% compared to the 5 PVs solution.},

The proposed approach allows to perform scenario analysis of regional contexts with an accurate and physically detailed representation of the energy supply chain, while keeping track of the indirect and sector-specific economic and environmental impacts induced by a prospective policy action: the features and capabilities of the proposed approach are not fully covered by currently available methods and models. The EPLANopt model was setup and run for a selection of prescriptive scenarios, identifying optimal Pareto solutions in terms of minimization of economic cost of energy and carbon dioxide emissions. The results were then processed and incorporated into the Input-Output model, which allowed to evaluate the economy-wide economic and environmental impacts of such scenarios for different sectors. Results of the soft-linked model complement those of the EPLANopt model alone, as they reveal significant economic and environmental indirect effects that characterize the analysed scenario and are thus important to support decision-making.},

abstract = {One of the most controversial topics in energy analysis consists in the internalization of the effects of human labor in the embodied energy requirements of goods and services. In this paper, the Bioeconomic Input-Output model is proposed to address such issue: it consists in a partially closed Hybrid Input-Output model in which the production of human labor is internalized within the economy as a new productive sector. The human labor sector absorbs a portion of the national final demand, while it produces working hours in order to sustain the national economic activities. The Bioeconomic model causes a reallocation of the total energy embodied in the production of goods and services due to two overlapping effects: a change in the national production technology due to the definition of the human labor sector, and a reduction in the available final demand for the consumptions of the households. The Bioeconomic and the standard Input-Output models are comparatively applied for the analysis of (1) the energy embodied in goods and services produced by the Italian economy in 2010, and (2) the primary energy requirements of alternative dishwashing solutions in Italy. Specific embodied energy in Italian products increases by less than 5% for mining and energy industries, by 5–15% for manufacturing industries and by 15–70% for tertiary sectors. On the other hand, the energy embodied in total production from each sector may be lower or greater (from −20% to +50%) with respect to results of the standard Input-Output model. Moreover, it is found that the energy embodied in dishwashing by hand and by dishwasher in Italy increases respectively by 62% and by 35% if the Bioeconomic model is adopted. Based on these results, Authors argue that human labor should methodically be included alongside the supply chain of goods and services in both embodied energy analysis and life-cycle assessment.},

This design is deployed on mono-feedstock-wet anaerobic digestion (WAD) principle. Little or nothing has been reported in the literature on the sustainability in terms of the actual field operation and performance of this design within the SSA context. This study aims at bridging this gap and bringing additional insights to the scientific literature by investigating the sustainability of the Nepali–type fixed dome digester within the context of rural Cameroon. The investigations were evaluated in terms of operating parameters, biogas production, production rate and productivity of the digester. In addition the local investment cost of the design was analyzed. The design was operated on multiple-locally-available feedstock mixed with water at an average of 3:1 ratio resulting in a higher than design TS of 16%. The design, thus was operated towards the dry anaerobic digestion principle, highlighting insufficient mono-feedstock and water scarcity for a sustainable operation of the design within the context of rural SSA. The average biogas production was 1.2 m3biogas/day, giving average volumetric production rate of 0.16 m3biogas/m3digester day−1 and yields of 0.18 m3biogas/kg VS respectively. This low performance compared with the potential mesophilic biogas production rate of 0.27 m3biogas/m3digester day−1 could be linked to insufficient mixing of digester content and low operating temperatures. Gas storage facility (dome), skilled labour and cement made significant contributions to the investment cost of the digester. The Levelized cost of Energy from the digester was less than 1 € cents/MJ.},

abstract = {The latest developments in solar technologies demonstrated that the solar central receiver configuration is the most promising application among concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. In CSPs solar-heated air can be used as the working fluid in a Brayton thermal cycle and as the heat transfer fluid for a Rankine thermal cycle as an alternative to more traditional working fluids thereby reducing maintenance operations and providing the power section with a higher degree of flexibility To supply thermal needs when the solar source is unavailable, an auxiliary burner is requested. This configuration is adopted in the Julich CSP (J-CSP) plant, operating in Germany and characterized by a nominal power of 1.5 MW, the heat transfer fluid (HTF) is air which is heated in the solar tower and used to produce steam for the bottoming Rankine cycle. In this paper, the J-CSP plant with thermal energy storage has been compared with a hybrid CSP plant (H-CSP) using air as the working fluid. Thermodynamic and economic performances of all the simulated plants have been evaluated by applying both exergy analysis and thermoeconomic analysis (TA) to determine the yearly average operation at nominal conditions. The exergy destructions and structure as well as the exergoeconomic costs of products have been derived for all the components of the plants. Based on the obtained results, the thermoeconomic design evaluation and optimization of the plants has been performed, allowing for improvement of the thermodynamic and economic efficiency of the systems as well as decreasing the exergy and exergoeconomic cost of their products.},

abstract = {In a European context characterized by growing need for operational flexibility across the electricity sector, the combined cycle power plants are increasingly subjected to cyclic operation. These new operation profiles cause an increase of production costs and decrease of revenues, which undermines the competitiveness of the combined cycles. Power plant operators need tools to predict the effect of off-design operation and control mechanisms on the performance of the power plant. Traditional Thermodynamic or Thermoeconomic models may be unpractical for the operators, due to their complexity and the computational effort they require. This study proposes a Thermoeconomic Input-Output Analysis model for the on- and off-design performance prediction of energy systems, and applies it to La Casella Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plant, in Italy. It represents a stand-alone, reduced order model, where the cost structure of the plant products and the Thermoeconomic performance indicators are derived for on- and off-design conditions as functions of the load and of different control mechanisms, independently from the Thermodynamic model. The results of the application show that the Thermoeconomic Input-Output Analysis model is a suitable tool for power plant operators, able to derive the same information coming from traditional Thermoeconomic Analysis with reduced complexity and computational effort.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the development, implementation and application of a novel mathematical procedure devoted to formulating the daily load profiles of off-grid consumers in rural areas. The procedure aims at providing such profiles as input data for the design process of off-grid systems for rural electrification. Indeed, daily load profiles represent an essential input for off-grid systems capacity planning methods based on steady-state energy simulation and lifetime techno-economic analyses, and for the analysis of the logics to control the energy fluxes among the different system components. Nevertheless, no particular attention has been devoted so far in the scientific literature as regards specific approaches for daily load profiles estimates for rural consumers. In order to contribute to covering this gap, we developed a new mathematical procedure taking into consideration the specific features of rural areas. The procedure is based on a set of data that can be surveyed and/or assumed in rural areas, and it relies on a stochastic bottom-up approach with correlations between the different load profile parameters (i.e. load factor, coincidence factor and number of consumers) in order to build up the coincidence behavior of the electrical appliances. We have implemented the procedure in a software tool (LoadProGen) which can eventually support the off-grid systems design process for rural electrification. Finally, we have applied the procedure to a case study in order to clarify the proposed approach.},

abstract = {In developing countries, energy is recognized to be essential for promoting equitable growth, fostering social inclusion and preserving the environment. Nevertheless, the current state of the energy sectors of developing countries still represents a major hindrance to the fulfillment of this goal. In this frame, electrical energy storage may allow a cost-effective exploitation of renewable sources in order to cope with the improvement of the power supply service via local national grids, but mainly it may become a building block of rural electrification through integration within off-grid systems. This paper focuses on electrical energy storage in sub-Saharan Africa providing an overview of the main aspects of this theme. Indeed, the specific features of the power sector in sub-Saharan Africa are analyzed about the framework of application of electrical energy storage. The typical technologies implemented in this context and the status of the market as well as of the economic models to support the diffusion of storage together with renewable energy technologies are highlighted. Moreover, an overview of technical aspects such as storage capacity sizing and interface converters for integration with renewables are described. Finally, an experimental application of a hybrid micro-grid in rural Tanzania is presented. With this paper, our aim is to provide an overall view, within the main technical and non-technical aspects, of electrical energy storage in a context – sub-Saharan Africa – which has a huge potential, both in market terms, but also with regards to the possibility to develop and implement alternative technical solutions which may be integrated in the power systems of high income countries as well.},

abstract = {In this work, the primary resources assessment of four different soil erosion remediation technologies, Geo-nets, Bio-mats, Geo-cells and Deep Rooting Plants (DRP), is performed applying the approach of the Exergy Life Cycle Assessment (ELCA). The ELCA provides a comprehensive framework to assess the primary resources requirements of products by means of the conversion of primary flows of energy and raw materials absorbed by a production process into exergy. The soil erosion technologies described in the work are analysed according to two complementary indicators: the annual average soil loss and the life cycle primary exergy requirements. The primary exergy requirement of the different applications is measured by means of three ELCA indicators: the Cumulative Exergy Demand (CExD), the Thermo-Ecological Cost (TEC) and the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from Natural Environment (CEENE). The specific context of the application is a highway slope of the size of 1 hectare situated along the A1 highway, near the town of Fabro (TR), in Italy. The results indicate that DRPs are the most suitable solutions. However, TEC, CExD and CEENE indexes of these technologies suggest the existence of hidden impacts related to land use. The same result characterises also Bio-mats, the technology with the highest contribution of renewable material along the life cycle phases. In conclusion, this work shows that the use of exergy based impact indexes for the environmental impact assessment supplies a wider framework and deeper insights of the environmental performance of production processes and products.},

abstract = {Production activities of modern economies are ultimately sustained by depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels. In the perspective of non-renewables displacement, an accurate evaluation of energy embodied in goods and services is crucial in order to select among alternative products or policies. Economic-based Input-Output models are widely used for this purpose: however, due to the increasing amount of international trades of products, definition of appropriate methods to account for the energy embodied in trades is nowadays crucial. In this paper, international trades treatment methods in Input-Output analysis are comprehensively formalized and applied to a case study based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). Energy embodied in final demand and in detailed products of key national energy sectors have been evaluated for the WIOD countries according to Single-Region and Multi-Regional models. It is found that an inappropriate use of international trades treatment models may produce very inaccurate estimations of numerical values of embodied energy. Three country groups has been identified, characterized by different ranges of fractions of imported/exported primary fossil fuels: Single-Region method A returns best results for countries of Group 1, with high values of fossil exports and low values of fossil imports; Multi-Regional method C is to be preferred for countries of Group 2, with high values of fossil imports and low values of fossil exports; finally, Single-Region method B returns lower deviations compared to other methods for countries of group 3, with low values of fossil imports and exports. This paper aims at supporting researchers in the field of Life Cycle Assessment in the application of Environmentally extended Input-Output analysis, finding the best trade-off between the efforts due to data collection and the accuracy of results.},

Moreover, scientific literature is increasingly addressing this issue through the concept of sustainability and appropriate technologies. With regards to this topic, we present a sizing methodology which better relates the results and the sizing process itself to the local context. Specifically, we address the research area of sizing methodologies for off-grid PV systems. Typically, the Loss of Load Probability (LLP) is a key parameter in these methodologies, but is difficult to set as regards the specific context. The proposed methodology employs the concept of Levelized Cost of Supplied and Lost Energy, it is based on the estimate of an economic Value of Lost Load, and eventually, the LLP results to be an output of the process. Therefore, the methodology uses only data characterizing the local situation and results better fit with population conditions. We also propose a simple approach to compute the Value of Lost Load and we apply the methodology for a rural area of Uganda. The results show that the methodology identifies a reliable system which supplies electricity with a fair cost while minimizing the energy bill of the consumers.},

abstract = {Access to electric power supply has always had a significant role in promoting improvements in all the society sectors, nevertheless nowadays 1.3 billion of people still do not have electricity access. Moreover, most of them live in rural areas of developing countries which are often isolated, scattered populated and characterized by poor infrastructure and services. In this situation, the growing consideration towards the target of universal access to energy has emphasized the role of rural electrification, and off-grid small-scale generation represents one of the most appropriate options. As a consequence, the scientific literature has devoted attention to this topic with a large number of papers. In this frame, the present analysis focuses on off-grid systems for rural electrification and provides a general framework to this topic and an analytical review of the literature. The work is based on the review of more than 350 papers mainly published from 2000 to 2014 within selected journals, and it is organized in two sections. In the first one we describe the role of small-scale generation systems throughout the process of electrification, the main features of rural areas and their typical energy uses, and we propose a new comprehensive taxonomy for off-grid systems for rural electrification. In the second one we develop an extensive review of the selected literature according to the proposed classification and to five main research areas: Technology: layout and components; Models and methods for simulation and sizing; Techno-economic feasibility analyses and sustainability analyses; Case studies analyses; Policy analyses. The work results in a comprehensive review which organizes and capitalizes the main fundamentals of the addressed topic and provides elements to get acquainted with the literature.},

abstract = {Off-grid systems based on PV and batteries are becoming a solution of great interest for rural electrification. Nevertheless, sizing these systems is not straightforward since it means matching unpredictable energy sources with uncertain demands while providing the best reliability and costs. In our opinion, the effect of users' energy consumptions uncertainty on the sizing of these systems has not been appropriately investigated. This paper addresses this issue and analyzes the effect of load profile uncertainty on the off-grid PV systems optimum design. Specifically a novel sizing methodology has been introduced based on: (i) an effective approach of modelling rural energy needs; (ii) an innovative stochastic method which formulates different possible realistic daily load profiles for un-electrified rural areas; (iii) a PV-battery techno-economic analysis via steady-state simulation; (iv) the evaluation of the optimum system sizing via a numerical method based on net present cost and loss of load probability. Finally, the proposed methodology has been applied to find the optimum size of an off-grid PV system for a peri-urban area of Uganda. The results show that the optimum system configurations are significantly affected by load profiles; consequently an approach to identify the robust solution with regards the assumed uncertainty is proposed.},

This study investigates different ways of allocating greenhouse gases emissions deriving from refining and upstream crude oil supply. Allocation methods based on mass, energy content, economic value and, innovatively, added-value, are compared with the marginal refining emissions calculated by CONCAWE's linear-programming model to the average EU refinery, which has been adopted as reference in EU legislation. Beside the most important transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, kerosene/jet fuel and heavy fuel oil), the analysis extends to petroleum coke and refinery hydrogen. Moreover, novel criteria, based on the implications due to hydrogen usage by each fuel pathway, have been introduced to test the consistency of the analyzed approaches. It is found that only two economic-based allocation methods are consistent with the introduced criteria. These two methods also give negative refinery emissions for heavy products, which is coherent with the marginal emissions calculated through the CONCAWE refinery model. The recommended allocation methods are transparent and use only publicly available statistical data, so they may be useful not only for future EU legislation, but also in jurisdictions where a representative refinery model is not available.},

abstract = {Exergy Life Cycle Assessment (ELCA) is proposed by literature to account for the exergy embodied in products of energy systems. In order to make results of ELCA comparable, supply chains that support the life cycle of the system should be analyzed through a unified model: this is one of the main concerns related to Life Cycle Assessment and Industrial Ecology disciplines. In this paper, Hybrid Input-Output analysis is proposed as the computational structure of ELCA: according to this method, national supply chains are modeled through the Monetary Input Output Tables (MIOTs) of national economies, a constantly updated and freely available data source. Then, the adopted national MIOT is expanded to include the detailed model of the considered energy system, hence defining a Hybrid Input-Output model. The (non-renewable) exergy embodied in electricity production and the Exergy Return on Investment (ExROI) are defined as the appropriate performance indicators based on ELCA. The introduced model is here adopted for the analysis of a Waste-to-Energy (WtE) power plant currently operating in the Italian context. It is found that the primary non-renewable exergy embodied in electricity produced by the analyzed WtE is non-negligible for both the construction (127.1 toe) and the operation phases (11.6 toe/y). Nonetheless, the plant is able to produce a net amount of electricity that pays back such primary non-renewable resources requirements about a hundred times. Finally, the joint application of Exergy Analysis and ELCA lead to improve the overall thermodynamic performances of the WtE system, increasing its exergy efficiency by 1%, and reducing the non-renewable exergy embodied in electricity production by 7938 toe.},

abstract = {In the last decades, thermoeconomic analysis emerged as a combination of exergy analysis and cost accounting principles, widely used for multiple purposes: to account for the exergy and economic costs of energy systems products, to derive the structures of such costs for the design optimization purpose, and to perform system diagnosis quantifying the source and the impact of malfunctions and dysfunctions within the analyzed process. Traditionally, thermoeconomic analysis is referred to as Exergy Cost Analysis or Exergoeconomic Cost Analysis. The former is based on the so-called Exergy Cost Theory, focused on the evaluation of exergy cost of the system products, while the latter is focused on the evaluation of monetary cost following the same theory. Currently, many practical approaches are available in the literature for the application of thermoeconomic analysis and Exergy Cost Theory to energy conversion systems, while a comprehensive classification, benchmarking and comparison of such approaches is missing. This paper aims to fill this gap through the following activities: first of all, a brief but comprehensive literature review related to the theoretical developments and applications of thermoeconomic analysis method is performed. Secondly and for the purpose of benchmarking, the main practical approaches identified for the application of Exergy Cost Theory are presented and formalized, including the fundamental aspects related to the definition of auxiliary relations and the reallocation of the exergy cost of the residues. Finally, the identified approaches are comparatively applied to the standard CGAM problem, and the advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. It is found that the definition of the functional diagram and the numerical solution of the system through input-output analysis seem to be more straightforward with respect to the other approaches, leading also to the formalization of an unambiguous method to reallocate the exergy cost of the residual flows.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Here, we propose an approach for supporting the design and performance evaluation phase of solar cooking technologies, to assess their eventual appropriateness for remote rural contexts, before proposing them for local field tests. The approach is based on (1) local context description and analysis, (2) design and construction of the solar cookers, and (3) thermodynamic performance evaluation. We used the approach to analyse 3 cookers for the area of Mutoyi, Burundi: a parabolic, a panel, and a box cooker. From phases 1 and 2, only panel and box cookers emerged as the technically viable solutions: They were sized, optimized, built, and tested. In phase 3, the thermodynamic evaluation indicated that the box cooker is inappropriate, since water does not reach high enough temperature. Instead, the panel cooker shows a Standardized Cooking Power of 46.85 W and a stagnation temperature higher than 75°C, which is able to bring the water to the boil when the environmental temperature is higher than 25°C. The thermal efficiency of the cooker resulted equal to 8.13%, while the mean integral temperature T m remained around 60°C for all the lab test replicates, higher than the minimum internal temperature to cook legumes. The results of the procedure applied to the case study indicate that the panel cooker can be proposed for local field tests with local food and cooking practices, for assessing its final appropriateness on the field.},

abstract = {In the world, the number of forcibly displaced people is arising. These people have several needs, especially in terms of food security. The humanitarian response usually focuses on food availability and access, while food processing is often neglected. In this framework, cooking technologies play an essential role. Many scientific studies and international reports address the issue of clean cooking technologies dissemination in developing countries. Less information is instead available in the literature for the specific case of humanitarian contexts, such as refugee and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps, or informal humanitarian settlements. Unsustainable and inefficient cooking technologies or practices can have direct impact on food preparation, and indirect effects on local biomass resources overexploitation, health of local people, and social conflicts between hosted and hosting communities. This study aims at presenting a systematic review of both scientific and grey literature on cooking technologies and related practices, including a selection of experiences from the implementation of cooking devices in humanitarian projects and programmes. The Authors conclude that the attention to the problem is arising, but still very few information is available, in terms of scientific research.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, the interest of the international community for the multiple interconnections among energy, environment, and society has widely increased. Today, the close link between energy and development is officially recognized. The 2030 development agenda identifies energy access as a necessary precondition for human and social promotion, as well as an instrumental right to fight poverty. Nevertheless access to sufficient, affordable, efficient, reliable, safe and clean energy is not yet an opportunity for all. In developing countries, the problem is critical, but evidence has also risen in emerging countries and, more recently, even in developed countries. A new culture of energy is needed at global level. Innovative solutions and strategies to match the economic growth with the multidimensional targets of sustainability, including environmental preservation and social inclusion, need to be developed. In this scenario, the academia and the scientific community may play a key role by reshaping and updating their traditional mission, based on education, research, and community outreach, with a vision of the society where the human being is settled back at the center of the stage.

abstract = {Understanding the energy metabolism of national economies is nowadays crucial for policymakers in order to define effective policies and to properly set energy efficiency targets. Energy accountings based on the traditional Production-based accounting method (PBA) allows to understand how primary energy is directly extracted, traded, transformed and used within each economy. On the other hand, Consumption-based accounting method (CBA) allows to understand the ultimate economic purposes of such energy flows. The information provided by the joint application of these approaches may provide useful and complementary insight on the national energy metabolism, allowing to identify hotspots for potential interventions from both the supply and demand side. This paper reviews PBA and CBA energy accounting methods, presenting a possible way for the joint use of their results, consistently represented by means of one unique Sankey diagram. This will be useful to have a comprehensive insight on the energy metabolism of national economies, supporting analysts and policymakers in the identification of energy efficiency hotspots. The method is applied to South Africa and to the neighbor country of Botswana, based on data provided by IEA energy statistics and the EORA26 Multi-Regional Input-Output model, taking into account non-renewable fossil energy (raw coal, crude oil and natural gas) and considering the reference year 2013. Results suggest that the joint use of PBA and CBA methods may provide useful information on the hidden energy links among national economies, helping analysts and policymakers in defining alternative energy efficiency policies. For this reason, the Authors argue that results of CBA should be provided alongside energy statistics based on the traditional PBA approach.},

abstract = {Faults and malfunctions occurring in engineering systems may cause additional resources consumptions and economic expenditures, thus their detection and isolation is of great practical significance. The procedure to discover faults is known as diagnosis, and it can be based on different techniques, depending on the purpose of the analysis: to predict the failure time of the component, or to quantify the inefficiencies of the system due to the anomaly. Among the existing approaches adopted to diagnose the energy systems, Thermoeconomic diagnosis provides useful information to detect the anomalies and to quantify its negative impacts. However, this method does not allow to identify possible strategies useful to reduce the inefficiencies caused by anomalies, which could be a crucial need for the system operator. To face this issue, this article proposes a method to perform Thermoeconomic diagnosis of energy systems that enables the analyst to understand the interdependencies between the components, and decomposing the main indicator resulting from Thermoeconomic diagnosis, known as malfunction. The method provides useful information for the system operators to define practical strategies to reduce the negative effects of malfunctions. This approach is also formalized and applied to the CGAM benchmark to highlight the practical achievements of this approach with numerical values. It is found that the proposed approach provides useful insight about the effects of malfunctions, and it may be helpful for system operators to reduce the negative impacts of the anomaly by pinpointing the component with higher contribution in total inefficiency of the system. In this specific case, proper intervention on the pinpointed component mitigated the total inefficiency of the system by almost 40%, and recovered the reference efficiency of the system.},

The Reference Energy System (RES) of the Egyptian power sector has been defined and implemented in the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS), based on two different energy scenarios. To increase the accuracy of the analysis, the discount rate on capital investments for the energy technologies has been imposed as a time dependent exogenous variable. Moreover, the robustness of the obtained results has been tested through a sensitivity analysis on the main exogenous parameters. It is found that Combined Cycles, Wind, and Photovoltaic rooftop systems are compatible technologies to be included in the future Egypt's power generation mix. In particular, based on the abundant Egypt's renewables resources endowments, wind power technology comes first in achieving the proposed target on renewables penetration in the country's generation mix, and it might be a feasible alternative to replace a part of the natural gas share. Moreover, the significant impact of discount rate on capitals on the final results is highlighted: low values of discount rate would skew generation mix to include higher investment cost technologies and vice versa.},

Humanitarian emergencies and post-emergencies are among the most critical situations: the utilization of traditional devices such as three-stone fires have a huge negative impact not only on food security but also on the socio-economic status of people, their health and the surrounding environment. Advanced Cooking Stoves may constitute better systems compared to actual ones, however, financial, logistic and time constraints have strongly limited the interventions in critical contexts until now. The innovative, low-cost Mewar Angithi insert for improving energy efficiency of three-stone fires may play a role in the transition to better cooking systems in such contexts. In this paper, we rely on the Water Boiling Test 4.2.3 to assess the performances of the Mewar Angithi insert respect to a traditional three-stone fire and we analyse the results through a robust statistical procedure. The potentiality and suitability of this novel solution is discussed for its use in critical contexts.},

At the light of this interconnection, a proper impact evaluation metric able to assess the main effects of energy projects at local level becomes necessary in order to highlight successful strategies. Relying on the Sustainable Livelihoods concept, this study proposes an Impact Evaluation Framework (IEF) to measure project impact as changes of target community's livelihoods. First, the IEF establishes a Capitals-Based Evaluation Hierarchy, taking its rationale from the literature: this first step responds to the needs of providing a standard and harmonized structure applicable to different projects. Secondly, the IEF develops a further Five-Step Procedure to respond to the concurrent need of flexibility and customization of specific projects. The conceptual methodology of the IEF might be used at different stages of project design: as a supportive methodology donors use in their programme of funds allocation or as an instrument experts use to quantitatively support their ex-post project evaluation. In the paper, the IEF is presented in the light of this second application and the procedure applied to a real project in Ethiopia. The set of information obtained with the IEF is compared to the final expert evaluation, commissioned by the donor and performed at the end of the project, showing the usefulness of IEF as a supportive methodology in the evaluation process.},

abstract = {The causal relationships between electrification and development of poor, rural communities are complex and contextual. The existing literature focuses mainly on the impact of rural electrification and electricity use on local socio-economic development, while the reverse feedbacks of various social and economic changes on electricity demand and supply have not been fully characterized. Most electricity access impact assessments assume linear, one-way effects and linear growth in electricity demand. However, the projections rarely match the reality, creating challenges for rural utilities. From a modelling perspective, the lack of attention to dynamic complexities of the electricity-development nexus prevents the appropriate modelling of electricity demand over time and, hence, informed planning for and sizing of power plants. With the goal to improve modelling of the electricity-development nexus, we undertake a comprehensive review and extensive analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on electricity access and its impact on rural socio-economic development, and vice versa. We characterize and describe the nexus between electricity access and development through graphical casual diagrams that allow us to capture, visualise and discuss the complexity and feedback loops. Based on this, we suggest guidelines for developing appropriate models able to include and simulate such complexities. Our analysis confirms that electricity use is interconnected through complex casual relations with multiple dimensions of socio-economic development, viz. income generating activities, market production and revenues, household economy, local health and population, education, and habits and social networks. The casual diagrams can be seen as a first step of the conceptualization phase of model building, which aims at describing and understanding the structure of a system. The presence of multiple uncertain parameters and complex diffusion mechanisms that describe the complex system under analysis suggests that systems-dynamic simulations can allow modelling such complex and dynamic relations, as well as dealing with the high uncertainties at stake, especially when coupled with stochastic approaches.},

abstract = {More than half a billion people will still lack reliable and affordable electricity in 2040 and around 1.8 billion may remain reliant on traditional solid biomass for cooking. Long-term energy planning could help to achieve the energy access targets in developing countries, especially in remote rural areas. Different studies exist on long-term rural electricity and thermal energy planning, but the different foci, terminology and methodologies make it difficult to track their similarities, weaknesses and strengths. With this work, we aim at providing a critical analysis of peer-reviewed studies on long-term rural energy planning, to help researchers in the field move across the diverse know-how developed in the last decades. The work resulted in the analysis of 130 studies and categorisation of 85 of them that focus on electricity, thermal energy, and oil supply in rural areas, under a number of rules clearly defined in the first part of the paper. We classify the studies in two consecutive steps, first according to their type and afterwards according to the methodology they employ to forecast the energy demand, which is one the most critical aspects when dealing with long-term rural energy planning. The work also provides specific insights, useful to researchers interested in rural energy modelling. Few studies assume a dynamic demand over the years and most of them do not consider any evolution of the future energy load, or forecast its growth through arbitrary trends and scenarios. This however undermines the relevance of the results for the purpose of long-term planning and highlights the necessity of further developing the forecasting methodologies. We conclude that bottom-up approaches, system-dynamics and agent-based models seem appropriate approaches to forecast the evolution of the demand for energy in the long-term; we analyse their potential capability to tackle the context-specific complexities of rural areas and the nexus causalities among energy and socio-economic dynamics.},

However, such approaches ignore the interactions that the energy sector has with other sectors in the economy, hence failing in quantifying the global impact of future energy technologies. This study assesses the economic and environmental impact of an institutional energy scenario in the Egyptian economy, by soft linking a bottom-up, technology-rich model (OSeMOSYS) with a top-down Input-Output model (IOA). Based on the prospective institutional scenarios for Egypt, the energy model assesses the evolution of the Egyptian electricity mix towards 2040. Then, the future energy scenario has been applied to the IOA model in terms of change in energy technology mix, change in final demand of electricity and change in national GDP production. It is found that while primary energy consumption and GHG emissions of the energy sector are likely to decrease in the next decades, a significant increase in the same indicators for all the other national sectors is expected, thus unveiling the need to increase and diversify the energy efficiency investments in all the Egyptian economy.},

This paper presents two datasets that represent time series with a high temporal resolution (five-minute time step) both for vehicles and bike sharing use in the city of Turin, located in Northern Italy. These high-resolution profiles have been obtained by the collection and elaboration of available online resources providing live information on traffic monitoring and bike sharing docking stations. The data are provided for the entire year 2018, and they represent an interesting basis for the evaluation of seasonal and daily variability patterns in urban mobility. These data may be used for different applications, ranging from the chronological distribution of mobility demand, to the estimation of passenger transport flows for the development of transport models in urban contexts. Moreover, traffic profiles are at the basis for the modeling of electric vehicles charging strategies and their interaction with the power grid.},

abstract = {In this paper, a hybrid tri-generation system is designed to produce LNG and freshwater simultaneously based on a multi-effect desalination system and analyzed using energy and exergy analyses. For natural gas liquefaction, the initially required cooling of the cycle is supplied by ammonia-water absorption system, and the required intermediate cooling load and liquefaction process are provided by a refrigeration system with mixed fluid. Two alternatives for providing power generation to the system and the required heat for driving the absorption cycle have been considered and compared. The first alternative relies on a natural-gas-fired power plant, while the second is based on steam-solar power plant with dish collectors. The former results in the total energy efficiency of 85.8% (LHV). The highest thermodynamic irreversibilities occur in the heat exchangers (61%), even if they have the highest exergy efficiency compared to the other plant equipment. On the other hand, using solar dish collectors enables to decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 40%, and increases freshwater and LNG production by 95% and 4.7% respectively. The power obtained per kg of LNG produced is about 0.19 kWh, which is less than or equal to the other similar patents. The results of the economic analysis with the annualized cost method of the system show that the products prime cost of both structures 1 and 2 are equal to 0.2580 and 0.1784 US$ per kg of LNG, respectively. A suitable strategy for modelling enhancement of system's parameters is suggested by expanding of sensitivity analysis on the important parameters of the developed system.},

abstract = {E orts towards ensuring clean and a ordable electricity for all have been progressing slowly in rural, o grid areas of developing countries. In this context, hybrid microgrids may o er reliable and potentially clean electricity for isolated locations. Nevertheless, the process of planning and operation of these systems faces several challenges, often due to the uncertainties related to the renewable resources and to the stochastic nature of electricity consumption in rural contexts. This paper tackles this problem and contribute to the literature by bridging the gap between field practices and two-stage stochastic modeling approaches by identifying an open-source modeling framework which is then applied to real local data. As reference case-study, we consider a microgrid built in 2015 in Bolivia. Overall, the optimal system results from a compromise between the Net Present cost, the peak capacity installed and the flexibility (to balance variable generation). Di erent approaches to size isolated microgrids are tested, with the conclusion that methods accounting for the uncertainty in both demand and renewable generation may lead to a more robust configuration with little impacts on the final cost for the community.},

To this end, this study proposes a multi-layer modelling methodology that soft-links (i) a stochastic bottom-up load curves estimation model, (ii) a technology-rich energy system optimisation model (Calliope) and (iii) a Multi-Regional Input-Output model (Exiobase v.3), and applies it to investigate the economic and environmental consequences entailed by a massive replacement of traditional gas-fired kitchens with induction kitchens within the Italian residential sector. Two scenarios are considered for the analysis: (i) business as usual (BAU, 2015 energy system configuration), and (ii) national energy strategy (SEN, configuration prospected in 2030). The results show how the intervention produces positive net effects on the primary energy balance of the energy sector only when sustained by adequate shares of renewables, as in the SEN (−1.5 TWh∙y−1); otherwise, increased operation of fossil-fuel plants offsets gas savings (BAU, +2 TWh∙y−1). Nonetheless, feedbacks on other productive sectors entail additional energy consumption and emissions, thus counterpoising positive effects obtained within the energy sector even in the SEN scenario. Still, higher renewables penetration reduces overall additional emissions from 2.07 Mton∙y−1 for BAU to 0.88 Mton∙y−1 for the SEN.},

abstract = {Energy access projects in remote off-grid areas would benefit from the adoption of a multi-energy system perspective, addressing all energy needs – not only lighting and power appliances, but also water-heating and cooking – by means of a mix of energy vectors. However, multi-energy analyses in remote areas are hindered by a lack of models allowing for the generation of multi-energy load profiles based on interview-based information characterised by high uncertainty. This study proposes a novel open-source bottom-up stochastic model specifically conceived for the generation of multi-energy loads for systems located in remote areas. The model is tested and validated against data obtained from a real system, showing a very good approximation of measured profiles, with percentage errors consistently below 2% for all the selected indicators, and an improved accuracy compared to existing approaches. In particular, some innovative features – such as the possibility to define and modulate throughout the day appliances' duty cycles – seem to be determinant in marking a difference with previous approaches. This might arguably be even more beneficial for case studies characterised by a larger penetration of appliances that are subject to complex and unpredictable duty cycle behaviour.},

This study aims at soft-linking a bottom-up approach for short- and long-term forecasts of load profiles with an energy optimisation model in a more comprehensive rural energy planning procedure. The procedure is applied to a small Indian community, and it is based on three blocks: (i) a bottom-up model to project households' electrical appliances, which adopts socio-economic indicators to make long-term projections; (ii) a stochastic load profile generator, which employs correlations and users' habits for assessing the coincidence and load factors; (ii) an energy optimisation model based on OSeMOSYS to find the economic optimum. The simulations show that demand models based on socio-economic indicators lead to more structured and less arbitrary scenarios. The soft-link with the energy optimisation model confirms that when accounting for short- and long-term variabilities of electricity demand together, the optimal capacities and costs can vary up to 144% and 50% respectively. Integrating optimisation tools to bottom-up models based on socio-economic indicators for forecasting electricity demand is therefore pivotal to set more reliable investments plans in rural electrification.},

abstract = {The growing complexity and the many challenges related to fast-changing and highly de-carbonised electricity systems require reliable and robust open source energy modelling frameworks. Their reliability may be tested on a series of well-posed benchmarks that can be used and shared by the modelling community. This paper describes and integrates stand-alone, independent modules to compute the costs and benefits of flexible generation options in the open source energy investment modelling framework OSeMOSYS. The modules are applied to a case study that may work as a benchmark. The whole documentation of the modules and the test case study are retrievable, reproducible, reusable, interoperable, and auditable. They create a case to help establish a FAIR-compliant, user-friendly, and low-threshold model and data standards in modelling practices. As is well known, one of the options for balancing high shares of variable renewables is flexible power generation by dispatchable units. The associated costs need to be considered for short-term operational analyses and for long-term investment plans. The added modules contribute to extending the modelling capacity by introducing (a) costs of ramping, (b) non-linear decrease of efficiency at partial load operation, and (c) refurbishment of existing units in the cost minimisation objective function of OSeMOSYS. From application to the test case study, two main insights are drawn: costs of ramping and decreased partial load efficiency may influence the competitiveness of generation technologies in the provision of reserve capacity; and refurbishment of existing units may represent attractive investment options for increasing flexibility. Both effects are also seen in the long-term and may impact infrastructure investment decisions to meet decarbonisation targets. These effects would not be captured without the introduction of the modules.},

abstract = {This paper deals with an economic aspect of distributed generation systems which rural energy cooperatives may mainly support, since they can effectively coordinate the different stakeholders within an energy access initiative. Members of a rural energy cooperative would share the costs of deploying a distributed generation system, so that each of them can benefit from it. To minimise the overall investment cost, such a cooperative must consider both technical sizing and cost allocation among its members. For the latter, an important issue to take into account is the so-called willingness-to-pay. For obtaining the design of the distributed generation system we propose to use facility location covering (FALCO) models. The solution of the FALCO model provides both the structure of the distributed generation system and the investment cost to be covered by the members of the cooperative. We take advantage of the structure of the primal and dual optimal solutions of the FALCO model to endogenously determine the minimum and maximum willingness-to-pay of the cooperative members and then to apply rationing techniques to obtain the final allocation of costs to each member. Thus, our approach optimises the generator locations and minimises the total system cost, while assigning to each member at least her minimum willingness-to-pay. From our point of view, this method may help the beneficiaries to accept the investment cost allocation. Finally, a case study based on real data from a rural village in Maharashtra, where a group of farmers wanting to buy and share an energy system to pump water for irrigating their fields, is used to illustrate the working of the proposed cost allocation methodology.},

Still, the techno-economic feasibility of e-cooking has never been evaluated through (i) a high-resolution assessment of the electric and cooking load profiles, coupled with (ii) a least-cost energy system optimisation for the related electricity supply. Hence, the present study aims at accurately investigating the techno-economic potential of a fully-renewable solar micro-grid, ensuring an integrated access to electricity and clean cooking, based on two representative case studies in Tanzania, namely: (i) a residential case study, and (ii) a community-service case study. Bottom-up stochastic load profiles are generated for the two contexts by expanding the existing LoadProGen model with a novel complementary algorithm for the computation of high-resolution cooking loads. The cost-optimised results prove the cost-competitiveness of e-cooking, especially for the community-service case, where it would require only an additional 17% capital investment due to the pre-existence of other energy-intensive activities. Moreover, the range of Levelised Cost for Cooking a Meal (LCCM) obtained for e-cooking considering the different scenarios lies within 0.16 ÷ 0.70 USD/kWh, a range that is comparable with that of all other cooking options – including firewood – and even more cost-competitive than LPG.},

abstract = {The electrification-based literature reports a limited knowledge about the mechanisms of evolution of electricity demand in off-grid settings, especially in remote contexts of developing countries, due to the lack of robust and appropriate modelling frameworks. Such lack of understanding and modelling endeavour contributes to an inefficient allocation of resources for electrification projects and inappropriate off-grid sizing processes. As a first step towards the development of a more appropriate electricity demand model, we present a comparative study of two approaches for modelling different diffusion mechanisms of electricity connections: system-dynamics and agent-based models. The latter includes the modelling of social network archetypes in the simulation of diffusion processes. We model different scenarios of diffusion and we use them for evaluating the impact on the sizing process of an off-grid hydroelectric system. The results suggest that the structure of the social network can represent a crucial parameter that can impact on timing needed to complete the diffusion of electricity access – from few months to even >10 years. This affects the sizing process and the long-term sustainability of the power system, leading to variation of the hydroelectric capacity and the battery size up to around 55% and 100%, respectively. Our results indicate that the agent-based approach allows a more diversified representation of diffusion processes, but the limitations and scarcity of data can be an obstacle to their prompt application for energy application in unelectrified areas. On the contrary, system-dynamics can represent a more appropriate method since it requires less quantitative data and it provides a more structural and holistic modelling framework for conceptualising and formulating in a the determinants and complexities affecting the evolution of electricity demand in unelectrified areas.},

Therefore, the identification of alternative suitable processes for the synergistic natural gas purification and LNG production, when the amount of CO2 in the raw gas feed is high, and their comparative thermodynamic assessment, is necessary to foster a cleaner and efficient production of LNG. In this paper, the energy intensity of the classical chemical absorption units using aqueous solutions of Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and the novel Dual Pressure Low-Temperature Distillation process (DPD) operating in different national contexts is assessed by means of the Net Equivalent Methane analysis and the Energy Life Cycle Assessment. These methods return respectively the equivalent methane and the embodied non-renewable energy invoked by the two alternative processes in one operating year. In general, the primary energy required by the construction phases of both the systems results negligible compared to the operation phase, and most of the latter is due to the consumption of energy utilities, which is strongly dependent by the considered national context. According to the results obtained by means of both the methodologies, the DPD process is generally less energy intensive compared to MDEA: the DPD process results to be an efficient and promising technique to perform the synergistic natural gas purification and LNG production.},

Modelling such cross-sectoral interconnections is thus highly relevant. In this work, these interactions are considered in a long-term perspective by uni-directional soft-linking of two models: JRC-EU-TIMES, a long term planning multisectoral model, and Dispa-SET, a unit commitment and optimal dispatch model covering multiple energy sectors such as power, heating & cooling, transportation etc. The impact of sector coupling in future Europe-wide energy systems with high shares of renewables is evaluated through five scenarios. Results show that the contributions of individual sectors are quite diverse. The transport sector provides the highest flexibility potential in terms of power curtailment, load shedding, congestion in the interconnection lines and resulting greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Nevertheless, allowing combinations of multiple flexibility options such as hydro for the long-term, electric vehicles and flexible thermal units for the short-term provides the best solution in terms of system adequacy, greenhouse gas emissions and operational costs.},

In this paper, the alternative Consumption-Based approach is proposed, and its effectiveness assessed: according to this approach, policy initiatives allocates responsibility for CO2 emissions proportionally to the CO2 emissions embedded in goods and services required by industries as inputs for production. Global environmental and economic consequences of carbon emissions reduction policies, applied at the European level based on both Production- and Consumption-Based paradigms, are comparatively assessed based on the World Trade Model with Bilateral Trades. Results of this study suggest that defining CO2 emissions policies based on a Consumption-Based paradigm seems to be the most effective way to reduce the global carbon emissions, avoiding the carbon leakage phenomenon which may occur in economies regulated by Production-Based policies. Indeed, an imposed reduction in CO2 emissions embedded in EU final demand through a Consumption-Based Accounting policy would result in a global CO2 emissions reduction up to almost 1.2 Gton. On the other hand, an imposed reduction in direct EU CO2 emissions according to a PBA approach would result in an overall increase in global carbon emissions up to almost 0.8 Gton.},

In this context, the present research proposes two scenarios to obtain a biomass-fueled power plant with limited CO2 emissions. A novel combination of a downdraft gasifier (DG), internally fired gas turbine, Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC), Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), and cryogenic separation unit, is proposed (named scenario 1) and it is compared to a system in which a bottoming steam cycle (SBC) was used instead of the ORC (named scenario 2). To have a deeper insight into the performance of the integrations, a sensitivity analysis and comparative study have been developed in this research in terms of their thermodynamic and economic performance. Sensitivity analysis explores the effects of significant variables on the proposed system performance: fuel cell current density, fuel cell steam to carbon ratio, gas turbine inlet temperature, and CO2 and fuel utilization factors. Exergy and exergoeconomic analyses reveal that the air-preheater in scenario 1 and gasifier in scenario 2 are identified as the component with maximum exergy destruction rate (21% and 14% of total respectively) and HRU in scenario 1 and SBC condenser have the lowest value of the exergoeconomic factor (3.76% and 0.01% respectively) due to high thermodynamic inefficiencies, while MCFC in both scenarios has the highest exergoeconomic factor 87.29% and 80.67% respectively due to its high investment cost. Also, scenario 1 achieves the amount of 83.86 (USD/MWeh) for LCOE that is 55.76 (USD/MWeh) more than the reference case and 3.55 (USD/MWeh) less than the scenario 2.},

abstract = {Integrated systems modelling has provided insights on pathways for the sustainable use of energy, land and water resources. Among the existing modelling tools, some have been widely used to engage policy makers, due to their open source and basic structure. Yet, in the attempt of simplifying the representation of integrated systems, essential features significantly influencing the dynamics between systems may have been left aside. This study proposes an improved formulation of the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS), for a better representation of energy and resource storage processes. In particular, the focus of this work is the storage losses introduction for both dams for hydropower generation and batteries for electricity storage. The modifications were applied to a case study representing key features of both a developed and developing country. The results highlight that, with low additional computational effort, a much more accurate representation of the storage technologies can be achieved. Despite the introduction of losses, renewable energy technologies tend to have a high penetration in the future energy mix thanks to storage applications that remedy their unpredictability and seasonality.},

abstract = {The standard ISO 14044:2006 defines the hierarchical steps to follow when solving multifunctionality issues in life cycle assessment (LCA). However, the practical implementation of such a hierarchy has been debated for twenty-five years leading to different implementation practices from LCA practitioners. The first part of this study discussed the main steps where the ISO hierarchy has been implemented differently and explored current multifunctionality practices in peer-reviewed studies. A text-mining process was applied to quantitatively assess such practices in the 532 multifunctional case studies found in the literature. In the second part of the study, citation network analysis (CNA) was used to identify the major publications that influenced the development of the multifunctionality-debate in LCA, i.e., the key-route main path. The identified publications were then reviewed to detect the origins of the different practices and their underlying theories. Based on these insights, this study provided some "food for thought"on current practices to move towards consistent methodology. We believe that such an advancement is urgently needed for better positioning LCA as a tool for sustainability decision-making. In particular, consistent allocation practices could be especially beneficial in bioeconomy sectors, where production processes are usually multifunctional, and where current allocation practices are not harmonized yet.},

This article draws attention to the potential complementary role of decentralized alternatives – primarily micro-grids – to address universal electricity access targets. To this aim, we propose a methodology consisting of three steps to estimate the LCOE and to size micro-grids for large-scale geo-spatial electrification modelling. In the first step, stochastic load demand profiles are generated for a wide range of settlement archetypes using the open-source RAMP model. In the second step, stochastic optimization is carried by the open-source MicroGridsPy model for combinations of settlement size, load demand profiles and other important techno-economic parameters influencing the LCOE. In the third step, surrogate models are generated to automatically evaluate the LCOE using a multivariate regression of micro-grid optimization results as a function of influencing parameters defining each scenario instance. Our developments coupled to the OnSSET electrification tool reveal an important increase in the cost-competitiveness of micro-grids compared to previous analyses.},

We model the multifaceted dimensions of the rural electricity-development nexus by formulating a system-dynamics model based on a Tanzanian case-study and using 13-years of data for calibrating it. The modelled structure provides the first quantitative step in the research committed to develop an appropriate modelling framework for deriving policy insights regarding the electricity-development nexus and the evolution of electricity demand for rural areas of developing countries. The simulation results show and highlight the dynamics behind the structural behaviour of some socio-economic system variables (e.g. income and IGAs growth), the exogenous determinants (e.g. accessibility of the rural village), and the complementary activities (e.g. micro-credit at electricity access) that allow electricity access to foster local socio-economic changes, which in turn supports the growth of electricity demand. Our findings allow increasing the understanding on the complex electricity-development nexus and providing a novel modelling framework for projecting the electricity demand for rural settings.},

abstract = {Designing highly renewable power systems involves a number of contested decisions, such as where to locate generation and transmission capacity. Yet, it is common to use a single result from a cost-minimizing energy system model to inform planning. This neglects many more alternative results, which might, for example, avoid problematic concentrations of technology capacity in any one region. To explore such alternatives, we develop a method to generate spatially explicit, practically optimal results (SPORES). Applying SPORES to Italy, we find that only photovoltaic and storage technologies are vital components for decarbonizing the power system by 2050; other decisions, such as locating wind power, allow flexibility of choice. Most alternative configurations are insensitive to cost and demand uncertainty, while dealing with adverse weather requires excess renewable generation and storage capacities. For policymakers, the approach can provide spatially detailed power system transformation options that enable decisions that are socially and politically acceptable. The planning of highly renewable power systems at any scale involves compromise across diverse stakeholders. We develop a method that generates a variety of spatially explicit, alternative system configurations that can be used to balance techno-economic feasibility with social and political goals. The application of our method to Italy reveals flexibility of choice for decisions like where to locate wind power and whether to invest in particular technologies. Technology substitution and complementarity is evident: solar photovoltaic and battery capacities expand together, as do wind and synthetic gas turbine capacities, all of which must notably increase to replace bioenergy's firm capacity. We also see that highly renewable systems rely on regional interconnectivity but that gas infrastructure is only useful at a fraction of current capacity. Our approach can be similarly applied to examine trade-offs in other national systems, as well as those at district and continental scales. We develop a computational method, which shows that there is a flexibility of choice to manage contested decisions arising when planning highly renewable power systems, such as where to locate wind capacity. Within this decision space, problematic technologies, such as bioenergy, are difficult and costly to replace and are not absolute must-haves. Expansion of PV is a must-have, coupled with battery when designed to cope with low-wind conditions. Carbon-neutral gas turbines can contribute to balancing but with a minor role compared with today's use.},

abstract = {The role of electricity availability in promoting the economic growth of low-income countries is a highly debated issue. Taking the Tanzanian government's view that a lack of infrastructure for power generation, together with a low electrification rate, are a limitation to growth, this paper studies the implications on the country's sustainable development of expanding the electricity sector. The analysis is based on the joint use of the OSeMOSYS open-source power system optimization model and the Leontief Input-Output model (based on the Tanzanian Social Accounting Matrix). Four scenarios are considered, representative of alternative technological and environmental policies, characterized by different timing to achieve full electrification. Results indicate that while an expansion of the electricity sector can contribute significantly to economic growth, the associated direct and indirect growth in carbon emissions is equally remarkable. Relying on the country's renewable generation potential would be important but might not be sufficient to lower the economy-wide carbon intensity, particularly under the assumption of reaching full access already in 2030. Targeting energy efficiency and/or decarbonization efforts in the industrial sectors as well as in the provisions of services would also be necessary. The latter is particularly relevant as, per effect of an average income increase, household consumption habits contributes to drive the economy away from its traditional, agricultural base.},

Nonetheless, the sizing of rural microgrids is complicated by the lack of models capable of accounting for the evolution of the energy demand over time, which is likely to occur in such contexts as a result of the modification of users' lifestyles. To tackle this issue, the present study aims at developing a novel, long-term optimisation model formulation, capable of accounting for load evolution and performing suitable investment decisions for capacity expansion along the time horizon. Multiple scenarios of load evolution are considered to evaluate the beneficial effects of this novel approach, through the coupling of the model with a tool for stochastic load profiles generation. The results show how this implementation brings lower Net Present Cost to the project and improved correspondence between actual electricity demand and microgrid sizing. Finally, a sensitivity analysis evaluates the robustness of the approach with respect to input data variability and the Loss of Load parameter.},

The proposed system consists of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), gas turbine, organic Rankine cycle (as the Waste-to-Energy technology), and a proton exchange membrane (PEME). PEME utilizing as a hydrogen production unit in order to cover a portion of SOFC fuel consumption rate and utilizing a waste-to-energy technology to provide more electricity generation are the distinguishing feature of proposed integration. The parametric analysis explores the effects of significant variables (such as the fuel cell current density, compressor pressure ratio, and organic Rankine cycle turbine inlet temperature on the system performance. The corresponding analysis provides such important following results: (1) increasing the SOFC's current density over a range of 2000–8000 (A/m2) decreases the energy and exergy efficiencies respectively from 17.92% to 12.74% and from 54.98% to 30.26%, (2) Although high overall exergy efficiency is achieved by reducing the compressor pressure ratio. By considering specific thermodynamic conditions which are obtained by parametric analysis, exergy and exergo-economic results reveal that the after-burner is identified as the component with maximum exergy destruction rate (21.44% of total) and it has the lowest value of the exergo-economic factor (0.006%) due to high thermodynamic inefficiencies, while the organic turbine has the highest exergo-economic factor 90.34% due to its high investment cost.

This approach is applied in five cities of Argentina. Firstly, the quantity of energy service provided (i.e., level of thermal comfort) for each city is evaluated and compared with the defined target. It is found out that heating comfort is guaranteed approximately as established, whereas in the cooling case the provision is twice the established level. Secondly, primary energy consumption of heating and cooling services is evaluated before and after different efficiency improvement policies. The results show that the major primary energy saving (52%) is obtained from the upgrading appliances scenario and reflect the importance of accounting for embodied energy in goods and services involved in interventions.},

The exhaust air flow from the gas turbine is completely recirculated to the combustion chamber to utilize the air's high-temperature potential as the oxidizer in the syngas combustion. Produced hot gasses flow into the hot temperature heat exchanger (HTHE) to raise the compressed air temperature up to the gas turbine inlet temperature. Besides this, the MCFC unit is utilized both for producing additional power for the retrofitting CO2 separation unit.

@article{Rocco2014,
abstract = {Objective: This paper presents a theoretical reassessment of the Extended Exergy Accounting method (EEA in the following), a comprehensive exergy-based analytical paradigm for the evaluation of the total equivalent primary resource consumption in a generic system.Our intent in this paper was to rigorously review the EEA theory and to highlight its double "valence" as a resource quantifier and to clarify its operative potential. On the one side, EEA can be properly regarded as a general "costing" theory based on a proper knowledge of the cumulative exergy consumption of different supply chains, economic systems and labour market: it is indeed the only method that translates externalities (capital, labour and environmental remediation) into cumulative exergetic costs and thus allows for their rigorous inclusion in a comprehensive resource cost assessment. Indeed, the extended exergy cost eec reflects both the thermodynamic "efficiency" of the production chain and the "hidden" resource costs for the society as a whole.From another, perhaps even more innovative, perspective, EEA can be viewed as a space and time dependent methodology since economic and labour costs can only be included in the Extended Exergy balance via their exergy equivalents (via two rigorously defined postulates). Since the equivalent exergy cost of the externalities depends both on the type of society and on the time window of the analysis, the extended exergy cost eec reflects in a very real sense both the thermodynamic "efficiency" of the machinery and the "conversion efficiency" of the specific society within which the analysis is performed.We argue that these two intrinsic features of the EEA method provide both additional insight in and more relevant information for every comparative analysis of energy conversion systems, both at a global and a local level.In the paper, traditional and advanced exergy analysis methods are briefly discussed and EEA theoretical foundations and details for its application are described in detail. Methods: The method converts not only material and energy flows, but externalities as well (labour, capital and environmental costs) into flows of equivalent primary exergy, so that all exchanges between the system and the environment can be completely accounted for on a rigorous thermodynamic basis.The current emphasis decision makers and by public opinion alike seem to be placing on sustainability generates the need for continue research in the field of systems analysis, and a preliminary review confirms that exergy may constitute a coherent and rational basis for developing global and local analysis methods. Moreover, extended exergy accounting possesses some specific and peculiar characteristics that make it more suitable for life-cycle and cradle-to-grave (or well-to-wheel) applications. Results: Taxonomy for the classification of exergy-based methods is proposed.A novel assessment of the EEA method is provided, its advantages and drawbacks are discussed and areas in need of further theoretical investigation are identified. Conclusions: Since EEA is a life-cycle method, it is argued that it represents an improvement with regard to other current methods, in that it provides additional insight into the phenomenological aspects of any "energy conversion chain". The paper demonstrates that the Extended Exergy cost function can be used within the traditional and very well formalized Thermoeconomic framework, replacing the economic cost function in order to evaluate and optimize the consumption of resources of a system in a more complete and rational way. Practical implications: This paper contains some specific proposals as to the further development of the EEA method, to increase its effectiveness and to improve its practical applicability for system analysis. Suggestions are made on how to include an EEA discussion in the current debate about sustainable development. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Most energy conversion systems, and especially electricity generation plants, do not operate at nominal conditions throughout their useful life: periodic, semi-periodic and stochastic changes in the availability of the resource affect solar (thermal and PV), wind, hydraulic, and geothermal plants, which in reality operate at off-design conditions for most of their life. To a smaller extent, fossil-fuelled plants may also be plagued by fuel availability problems and no longer easily predictable demand oscillation. In spite of the ever growing net connectivity, since the demand curve in even larger geographic regions displays a typical quasi-sinusoidal shape, fleet load modulation is unavoidable. Naturally, off-design operation and load cycling affect the cost of the generated kWh.This paper presents a general thermoeconomic method to evaluate the economic and environmental effects of energy system integration, taking into account life cycle concerns (supply chains) and the effect of inefficiencies due to off-design operation of the systems. The method here is applied to a realistic case study of an Italian regional utility: an analysis of the implications of the variation of the productive mix between a photovoltaic power plant (PV) and a standard commercial, non-cogenerating gas turbine plant (GT) on the final cost of the electrical kWh. The demand curve is prescribed, and the effect of different mixes is assessed, both on the monetary and on the exergy cost of the electricity.The economic cost assessment is performed by standard thermoeconomic techniques, whereas the exergy costs are evaluated using both the Extended Exergy Accounting (EEA) and the Thermo-Ecological Cost (TEC) methods. The results show that a purely monetary cash flow accounting and thermo-economics lead to contrasting results, and also that the EEA and TEC cost indicators generate different rankings among the studied alternative GT/PV mixes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. During recent years, the issue of gas flaring has become an increasingly relevant problem for the international community. The claim to more sustainable development offers a renewed prospective in the observation of gas flaring and emphasizes that recovering the associated gas could induce economic, environmental and social benefit. The true core of the issue, as is widely accepted, is not a lack of appropriate technologies, but in the number of criteria involved, which makes it difficult to identify a list of alternatives and connecting all the involved stakeholders in the negotiation process. The complexity of this problem can be mitigated using a decision-making method. The objective of the present work is to identify and formulate a supportive decision system based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Application of the model to a real case underlines the strengths and weaknesses of the model, leading to the conclusion that a selection of the most sustainable alternatives needs to be based on a number of criteria that need to be recognized and agreed amongst the stakeholders.},

abstract = {Due to the rapid increase of the World's primary energy demand of the last decades, low-temperature processes for the purification of natural gas streams with high carbon dioxide content has gained interest, since they allow to make profitable exploitation of low-quality gas reserves. Low temperature purification processes allow the direct production of a methane stream at high purity and at low-temperature, suitable conditions for the direct synergistic integration with natural gas cryogenic liquefaction processes, while CO2is obtained in liquid phase and under pressure. In this way, it can be pumped for transportation, avoiding significant compression costs as for classical CO2capture units (where carbon dioxide is discharged in gas phase and at atmospheric pressure), and further uses such as Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) or underground storage. In this paper, the three most common natural gas low-temperature purification techniques have been modelled and their performances have been evaluated through energy and exergy analyses. Specifically, the dual pressure low-temperature distillation process, the anti-sublimation process and a hybrid configuration have been considered. It is found that the dual pressure low-temperature distillation scheme reach the highest thermodynamic performances, resulting in the best values of exergy efficiency and equivalent methane requirements with respect to the other configurations. This is mainly due to the distributed temperature profile along a distillation column, resulting in a less irreversible heat exchanging process.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an exergy-based well-to-wheels analysis to compare different passenger vehicles, based on three key indicators: petroleum energy use, CO2emissions, and economic cost. A set of fuel pathways, including petroleum-based fuels, compressed natural gas, biofuels, and electricity are considered in five representative national energy mixes, namely Brazil, China, France, Italy, and the United States of America. Results show no fundamental difference in the fossil fuel pathways among the five scenarios considered. Compressed natural gas vehicles and electric vehicles can completely displace oil consumption in the personal transportation sector. Compressed natural gas vehicles also reduce CO2emissions by over 20% compared to gasoline vehicles. Emissions from electric vehicles greatly vary depending on the electricity mix. In low-carbon electricity mixes electric vehicles reach almost-zero CO2emissions, while the use of biofuels leads to the lowest CO2emissions in carbon-intensive electricity generation mixes, where vehicles running on E85 could reduce CO2emission by over 50% compared to gasoline vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles show the lowest overall economic cost, due to improved efficiency and low cost of petroleum-based fuels. Vehicles running on electricity are characterized by significantly higher capital cost and lower operating costs. Thus, different electricity generation costs impact minimally the overall cost. These results can be used to inform decision-makers regarding the multi-dimensional impact of passenger vehicles, including environmental impact, economic cost, and depletion of primary energy resources, with particular focus on petroleum.},

In this perspective, we discuss how this capacity is supported by energy and climate-economy models, and how international modelling teams are organised within structured communication channels and consortia as well as coordinate multi-model analyses to provide robust scientific evidence. Noting the lack of such a dedicated channel for the highly active yet currently fragmented European modelling landscape, we highlight the importance of transparency of modelling capabilities and processes, harmonisation of modelling parameters, disclosure of input and output datasets, interlinkages among models of different geographic granularity, and employment of models that transcend the highly harmonised core of tools used in model inter-comparisons. Finally, drawing from the COVID-19 pandemic, we discuss the need to expand the modelling comfort zone, by exploring extreme scenarios, disruptive innovations, and questions that transcend the energy and climate goals across the sustainability spectrum. A comprehensive and comprehensible multi-model framework offers a real example of “collective” science diplomacy, as an instrument to further support the ambitious goals of the EU Green Deal, in compliance with the EU claim to responsible research.},

abstract = {Designing highly renewable power systems involves a number of contested decisions, such as where to locate generation and transmission capacity. Yet, it is common to use a single result from a cost-minimizing energy system model to inform planning. This neglects many more alternative results, which might, for example, avoid problematic concentrations of technology capacity in any one region. To explore such alternatives, we develop a method to generate spatially explicit, practically optimal results (SPORES). Applying SPORES to Italy, we find that only photovoltaic and storage technologies are vital components for decarbonizing the power system by 2050; other decisions, such as locating wind power, allow flexibility of choice. Most alternative configurations are insensitive to cost and demand uncertainty, while dealing with adverse weather requires excess renewable generation and storage capacities. For policymakers, the approach can provide spatially detailed power system transformation options that enable decisions that are socially and politically acceptable. The planning of highly renewable power systems at any scale involves compromise across diverse stakeholders. We develop a method that generates a variety of spatially explicit, alternative system configurations that can be used to balance techno-economic feasibility with social and political goals. The application of our method to Italy reveals flexibility of choice for decisions like where to locate wind power and whether to invest in particular technologies. Technology substitution and complementarity is evident: solar photovoltaic and battery capacities expand together, as do wind and synthetic gas turbine capacities, all of which must notably increase to replace bioenergy's firm capacity. We also see that highly renewable systems rely on regional interconnectivity but that gas infrastructure is only useful at a fraction of current capacity. Our approach can be similarly applied to examine trade-offs in other national systems, as well as those at district and continental scales. We develop a computational method, which shows that there is a flexibility of choice to manage contested decisions arising when planning highly renewable power systems, such as where to locate wind capacity. Within this decision space, problematic technologies, such as bioenergy, are difficult and costly to replace and are not absolute must-haves. Expansion of PV is a must-have, coupled with battery when designed to cope with low-wind conditions. Carbon-neutral gas turbines can contribute to balancing but with a minor role compared with today's use.},

abstract = {The relevance of sector coupling is increasing when shifting from the current highly centralised and mainly fossil fuel-based energy system to a more decentralized and renewable energy system. Cross-sectoral linkages are already recognized as a cost-effective decarbonisation strategy that provides significant flexibility to the system. Modelling such cross-sectoral interconnections is thus highly relevant. In this work, these interactions are considered in a long-term perspective by uni-directional soft-linking of two models: JRC-EU-TIMES, a long term planning multisectoral model, and Dispa-SET, a unit commitment and optimal dispatch model covering multiple energy sectors such as power, heating & cooling, transportation etc. The impact of sector coupling in future Europe-wide energy systems with high shares of renewables is evaluated through five scenarios. Results show that the contributions of individual sectors are quite diverse. The transport sector provides the highest flexibility potential in terms of power curtailment, load shedding, congestion in the interconnection lines and resulting greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Nevertheless, allowing combinations of multiple flexibility options such as hydro for the long-term, electric vehicles and flexible thermal units for the short-term provides the best solution in terms of system adequacy, greenhouse gas emissions and operational costs.},

abstract = {In the current and forecasted energy scenario, Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plants are requested increasingly flexible operation. The continuous changes in the capacity factor of the power plants and the increasing number and steepness of ramp-ups could largely affect the thermodynamic and economic performance of the plants and undermine their competitiveness. In order for industrial operators to adopt competitive strategies to increase the flexibility of the power plants, the effect that off-design operation has on the cost structure of plant products needs to be addressed. Thermoeconomics provides tools and models to meet such objective. The study presents an application of Thermoeconomic Input-Output Analysis (TIOA) to a NGCC power plant subject to flexible operation in Italy. The on- And off-design performance of the plant is assessed, considering two load control mechanisms for off-design operation: Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) with constant Turbine Outlet Temperature (TOT) or constant Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT). The Input-Output model is derived from a detailed off-design Thermodynamic model designed in Thermoflow Thermoflex™, and it is stand- Alone: it computes the cost structure of the plant products and the Thermoeconomic performance indicators as continuous functions of the gas turbine load, independently from the Thermodynamic model. In the first place, the on- And off-design models of the plant are set up. Secondly, the detailed economic cost analysis is performed. Eventually, the stand- Alone Input -Output model is derived: The Technical Coefficients and the Input Coefficients are computed from the fuels and products in the Thermodynamic model at different loads; by regression of the obtained values, continuous functions of the load are derived for each coefficient; finally, the stand- Alone model is designed, including these functions in the Leontief Inverse matrix. The results provide an evaluation of the off-design performance of the power plant for the two control strategies, and a tool for the choice of the most efficient one. After specialised analysts set up and run the off-design Thermodynamic model, the power plant operators may perform production scenarios and predictions through the stand- Alone Input-Output model independently. This may help abate barriers for industrial practitioners, given by the complexity, computational effort and difficult interpretation of off-design thermodynamic and cost models.},

abstract = {The growing concern about the limited reserves of fossil fuels has led research efforts in the energy field on increasing thermodynamic efficiency of energy conversion systems. Although the operation of renewable power plants avoids direct depletion of fossil fuels, literature points out that both direct and indirect contributions to primary fossil fuel depletion occur in every phase of the system life cycle (LC). In this perspective, a fair and meaningful thermodynamic performance evaluation and optimization process should take into account such primary fossil fuel depletion. Boundaries of traditional methods such as Thermoeconomic Input Output analysis (TIOA) are limited to the considered system, neglecting the additional consumptions due to non-energy related goods and services. Therefore, design improvements proposed through TIOA should be verified in the perspective of primary resources consumption: indeed, not necessarily a reduction of irreversibilities within the considered system are accompanied by a reduction of primary resources requirements. The present work aims at improving the standard Thermoeconomic Input Output analysis (TIOA) in order to account for the primary exergy cost of energy system products: The novel method of Exergy-based Input-Output Analysis (ExIO) is then proposed, which models all the supply chains that feed the Life Cycle of the analyzed system through the national Monetary Input Output Tables (MIOTs). Beside traditional thermoeconomic indicators, such as the exergy cost of products and the exergy cost of exergy destructions, appropriate indicators based on ExIO method are here defined: Primary exergy cost of products and Exergy Return on (Exergy) Investment (ExROI). Standard TIOA and the novel ExIO method are then applied for the analysis and design evaluation of a Waste- To-Energy (WtE) power plant operating in the Italian context. Exergy cost and primary exergy cost of electricity are computed, together with the related thermoeconomic indexes, revealing that that the indirect fossil-fuel consumption related to the Life-Cycle of a WtE facility is not negligible; nonetheless, the plant is able to produce a net amount of useful exergy to completely pay back its primary fossil fuels consumption more than 100 times.},

abstract = {Economic growth of modern economies is strongly connected with fossil fuels consumption, namely coal, crude oil and natural gas. Due to the rising environmental concern over the last decades confirmed by the recent international commitments taken at COP21 at the end of 2015, a massive attention has been dedicated (and still need to be dedicated) to promote a more and more efficient use of non-renewable primary energy resources and to assess overall responsibility associated to their consumption. To be able to fulfil this goal, the national economies need to account their direct primary energy consumption, which is the trade of oil, gas and coal imported by other countries, as well as their indirect consumption, defined as the oil, gas and coal embodied within the goods and services traded with other economies. In this paper, Input-Output analysis is employed to assess both direct and indirect trades of energy resources among countries. More specifically, Multi-Regional Monetary Input-Output Tables are used here as the reference to identify direct trades of primary energy among national economies, while the Leontief model is adopted to calculate embodied energy in goods and services endogenously consumed and traded. Besides its traditional application, a modified version of the Leontief model is here used to identify the source of primary energy embodied in goods and services, i.e. where the primary energy is ultimately extracted to deliver the amount of goods and services consumed by each economy as final demand. The analysis relies on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), and it is conducted for 7 major World country aggregates, with focus on year 2011. The comparison among such obtained results could be relevant for analysts and policy makers, in order to understand the energy dependency of each country and to assess benefits of economic and energy policies.},

abstract = {Traditional bottom-up energy models have been widely applied so far to assess the future energy technologies over a specific time horizon, quantifying the direct economic and environmental implications of future energy scenarios. However, such approaches ignore the interactions that the energy sector has with other sectors in the economy, hence failing in quantifying the global impact of future energy technologies. This study assesses the economic and environmental impact of an institutional energy scenario in the Egyptian economy, by soft linking a bottom-up, technology-rich model (OSeMOSYS) with a top-down Input-Output model (IOA). Based on the prospective institutional scenarios for Egypt, the energy model assesses the evolution of the Egyptian electricity mix towards 2040. Then, the future energy scenario has been applied to the IOA model in terms of change in energy technology mix, change in final demand of electricity and change in national GDP production. It is found that while primary energy consumption and GHG emissions of the energy sector are likely to decrease in the next decades, a significant increase in the same indicators for all the other national sectors is expected, thus unveiling the need to increase and diversify the energy efficiency investments in all the Egyptian economy.},

abstract = {Countries around the world are preparing to give the last leap to accomplish a 100 % of rural energy access. Nonetheless, country-wide electrification planning requires the analysis of hundreds of un-electrified villages with different social, economical and geographical backgrounds. State-of-the-art planning models typically handle this computationally challenging task relying on highly-simplified technological characterizations, at the expense of a proper estimation of the cost-optimal potential of off-grid technologies, particularly micro-grids. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning method to improve such technological characterization while keeping the computational tractability of the problem under control. Firstly, field surveys from rural un-electrified villages in Bolivia are used as an input for a stochastic load generator model, creating several demand scenarios for a set of different village archetypes; secondly, renewable energy time series for representative locations of Bolivia are created using the NASA database. For each demand and renewables potential combination, a two-stage stochastic sizing model is adopted to obtain the corresponding cost-optimal micro-grid configuration. Finally, these data are used to train a Gaussian process regression with the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) as dependent variable and the daily average demand, renewable energy, and techno-economic characteristics of the components as independent variables. The results show that the trained algorithm is ultimately able to identify the LCOE of microgrids in given conditions, out of the training dataset, with satisfying accuracy and limited computational effort.},

abstract = {The cost structure of the products plays a crucial role in exergoeconomics. The cost structure is obtained by combining the cost balance and the exergy balance once the exergy costing principle is applied to exergy streams. The cost structure provides the specific cost of the product as function of three components: fuel cost, cost of the destruction and investment cost. Considering a k-th component of a given supply chain, the fuel and exergy destruction costs are linked to the upstream components while the cost of investment is related to the component k itself. A new extended cost structure decomposition able to identify the effects of costs formed in the supply chain serving a specific component is introduced. In detail, the generic unit fuel cost is substituted by the unit exergy cost of available exogenous resources. The proposed formulation does not change the final value of the cost of the products but instead isolates different cost contributions coming from upstream components. The extended cost structure is implemented in advanced exergy-based analysis giving birth to a new approach defined as modified advanced exergoeconomics. Modified advanced exergoeconomics and traditional advanced exergoeconomics are applied to an air compression industrial system in two configurations: (i) standard one and (ii) least-cost one. In the least-cost configuration, the overall plant cost is minimised by means of a continuous optimisation after having assumed functions of cost for the system components. Comparing the results of two methodologies in the two configurations, the values of exergoeconomic factors (f) computed according to the modified advanced exergoeconomics, result to be higher and closer to the point in which exergy destruction and investment cost do equate.},

abstract = {Distributed Generation is driving a paradigm shift in traditional power systems, allowing the production of renewable electricity and thermal energy close to the main energy consumption nodes (e.g., buildings). In this sense, thermal networks and electrical grids for Smart districts /cities have a key role, allowing the interconnections of distributed energy resources (renewables, combined heat and power generators, etc storage systems, and loads (electrical and thermal), locally dispatching supply and demand. In the present work, a multi-energy system for a new nearly zero energy and low carbon district near Milan (Italy) is proposed and analysed. After the evaluation of thermal and electrical energy needs of the district, an innovative thermal and electrical multi-energy system is designed with the specific aim to integrate multiple renewable energy sources (i.e., photovoltaics and groundwater energy) and energy storage technologies (i.e., sensible thermal storages), obtaining the best matching with thermal and electrical loads. Final results demonstrate the achievable benefits of the proposed solution, which can be successfully applied in several contexts.},

abstract = {Rural electrification plays a key role in terms of achieving the target of universal access to electricity by 2030. In order to deploy reliable and sustainable solutions, the sizing phase of decentralized power systems requires specific inputs such as long-term forecasts of the electricity load. In rural contexts, access to electricity is extremely interlinked to social-economic complex dimensions that in turn, influence the electricity demand. In this paper, we rely on System Dynamics for modelling such complexities, and we calibrate the results with data from a hydroelectric-based electrification programme implemented in 2005 in the rural community of Ikondo, Tanzania. We coupled the model with a newly extended version of a load stochastic tool, namely Lifetime – LoadProGen, in order to introduce a more reliable and calibrated approach to long-term electricity load forecasts.},

abstract = {Robust sizing of rural micro-grids is hindered by uncertainty associated with the expected load demand and its potential evolution over time. This study couples a stochastic load generation model with a two-stage stochastic micro-grid sizing model to take into account multiple probabilistic load scenarios within a single optimisation problem. As a result, the stochastic-optimal sizing of the system ensures an increased robustness to shocks in the expected load compared to a bestcase (lowest-demand) sizing, though with a lower cost and better dispatch flexibility compared to a worst-case (highest-demand) sizing. What is more, allowing just a 1% unmet demand enables to significantly improve the cost-competitiveness and the renewables penetration as all the not supplied energy is located in a negligible fraction of the unlikeliest highest demand scenarios.},

abstract = {With pressing priorities in the development agenda, policy makers in developing countries are in the difficult situation of prioritizing policy actions. Limited government and utility budgets need cost effective solutions to bring the desired development benefits of electrification, health, education and food security among others. Energy access is a prerequisite for economic activity and for human development as interacts in synergy with other development needs. As rural electrification models usually focus on the supply of electricity solely, thermal energy needs, such as cooking and water heating remain unattended and satisfied by non-renewable energy fuels. To this aim, we explore optimal electrification solutions addressing two types of energy demands, electricity and thermal energy demands for cooking. Our model builds on a 3-step electrification methodology proposed by Pe{\~{n}}a et al. including electricity as a modern source of clean energy for cooking in rural communities. The total investments needed to build and operate the microgrids, including distribution costs, is 332 million USD. This is equivalent to 1129 USD/per inhabitant. This amount does not account however the health and environment benefits that e-cooking can bring to inhabitants in Bolivian low-lands.},

abstract = {Most energy conversion systems, and especially electricity generation plants, do not operate at nominal conditions throughout their useful life: periodic, semi-periodic and stochastic changes in the availability of the resource affect solar (thermal and PV), wind, hydraulic, and geothermal plants, which in reality operate at off-design conditions for most of their life. To a smaller extent, fossil-fuelled plants may also be plagued by fuel availability problems and no longer easily predictable demand oscillation. In spite of the ever growing net connectivity, since the demand curve in even larger geographic regions displays a typical quasi-sinusoidal shape, fleet load modulation is unavoidable. Naturally, off-design operation and load cycling affect the cost of the generated kWh.This paper presents a general thermoeconomic method to evaluate the economic and environmental effects of energy system integration, taking into account life cycle concerns (supply chains) and the effect of inefficiencies due to off-design operation of the systems. The method here is applied to a realistic case study of an Italian regional utility: an analysis of the implications of the variation of the productive mix between a photovoltaic power plant (PV) and a standard commercial, non-cogenerating gas turbine plant (GT) on the final cost of the electrical kWh. The demand curve is prescribed, and the effect of different mixes is assessed, both on the monetary and on the exergy cost of the electricity.The economic cost assessment is performed by standard thermoeconomic techniques, whereas the exergy costs are evaluated using both the Extended Exergy Accounting (EEA) and the Thermo-Ecological Cost (TEC) methods. The results show that a purely monetary cash flow accounting and thermo-economics lead to contrasting results, and also that the EEA and TEC cost indicators generate different rankings among the studied alternative GT/PV mixes.},
