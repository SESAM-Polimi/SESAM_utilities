# SESAM_utilities
Simple set of classes containing useful functions that may be adopted in general applications

# How to use
Save the code in a folder nested within your "site-packages" folder. If you are using anaconda, the "site-packages" folder should be nested in the following path:

"C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages".

The code should be contained in the following folder 
"C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\SESAM_utilities".

Please, run the "try_me.py" script contained in the "example" folder to understand how to use the functions stored in the classes. 
The example runs the function "bibtex parser", which generates an .xlsx file from the list of documents published within the SESAM research group contained in a .bib file
